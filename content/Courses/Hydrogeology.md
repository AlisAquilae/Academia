# 🔎 Introduction
This course consists of three main parts 1) an exploration of the field of hydrogeology, and an explanation and application of its main principles; 2) an introduction to the numerical modelling of groundwater flow with examples from a variety of geological settings; 3) a course demonstrating hydrogeological field data collection and interpretation.

# 📖 Course Material
The literature for this course consists of 3 readers
1. [[Lecture Notes Hydrogeology (2024)]]
2. [[Manual Groundwater Modelling (2024)]]
3. [[Manual Hydrological Field Survey (Ardennes) (2024)]]

In addition, large part of the lectures covers content from the book [[Hiscock & Bense (2021)-Hydrogeology-Principles and Practice|Hydrogeology: Principles and Practice 2nd edition]] by Kevin M. Hiscock and Victor F. Bense.
