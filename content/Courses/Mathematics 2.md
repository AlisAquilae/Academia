# ðŸ”Ž Introduction
The course is a basic course in applied mathematics relevant to the technological, life and  
environmental sciences at Wageningen University. Subjects from analysis including (biological,  
physical and economic) applications are treated. The course aims at acquiring mathematical knowledge, insight and skills that are important for the different study programmes. An important theme is the development of quantities in the course of time, in particular the behaviour in the long run.

# ðŸ“– Course Material
The literature for this course consists of *Mathematics that Works Volume 2* (2020, 2nd Ed.) by Maarten de Gee. The ISBN is 978-90-5041-168-4

>[!Warning]
>This course only engages with part of the book. The notes therefore jump through chapters here and there. In addition, only chapters 1 through 6 are included. Later parts of the book are included in the course [[Mathematics 3]]

# ðŸ”— Summaries
There is no sub-dividing the course content into smaller parts. There is therefore only one summary for the entire course.
