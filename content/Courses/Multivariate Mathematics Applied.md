# ðŸ”Ž Introduction

Study of physical, chemical or biological systems requires mathematical and systems knowledge for analysis and interpretation of the systemâ€™s behaviour. In this course, the basic concepts that reveal the behaviour of systems as mechanical systems, gene networks, and transport flows are discussed. This course is based on a systems approach for defining subunits of the systems, and uses differential equations to find the time behaviour of the systems. Matrix calculus that supports these techniques and methods for the interpretation of results and data obtained from experiments are discussed. For processes that do not depend only on time but also on space, additional tools are required. Here multidimensional calculus (differentiation and integration) is discussed. The fundamentals of physical transport are treated, and the resulting partial differential equations are derived. Elementary techniques for solving and analysing partial differential equations are treated
