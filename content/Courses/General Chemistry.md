# ðŸ”Ž Introduction
Though this is classified as a 'course', all notes categorised under 'General Chemistry' do not in fact belong to a course given at the WUR. Instead, this contains notes on high-school chemistry. Not all notes have been included; only those which I deem relevant to the hydrological track. 

>[!Warning]
>The notes contained here are often based on an NHA-Homestudy I did, originating from 2022, and supplemented with snippets of information I had to look up and which did not belong to another course. Note that the NHA course was in Dutch, and I had to do my own translations. The actual contents of this 'course' might therefore not correspond to your highschool chemistry knowledge, either due to differences in teaching material between years, differences in teaching methodologies, errors made in the process of translation, or due to my own additions
