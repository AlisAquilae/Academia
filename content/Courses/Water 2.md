# ðŸ”Ž Introduction
The course presents an overview of the role of soil and water in the landscape. Central topic is the  
diversity and coherence in space and time, especially the factors that determine the role of water for human use and nature.

# ðŸ“– Course Material
The literature for this course consists of a reader which has been divided into 3 parts

## 1. Catchment Hydrology
You already learned much about catchments, hydrological processes, the [[Hydrograph]] and the [[Water Balance]] in chapter 2 of the course [[Water 1]]. This chapter continues on that knowledge and we will get deeper into the subject of river discharges. In Section 2.2, you will learn how hydrological models are used to simulate river responses to rain showers. We will especially focus on discharges from surface waters and baseflow (basisafvoer, the slow groundwater flow  
towards the river). Section 2.3 will go deeper into the most important situations: extremes. You will learn how to calculate occurrence probabilities for floods and extreme rainfall, how to use this information for design purposes and how to analyse low flows. Finally, we give you some more information on the streamflow (hydraulics) in the rivers themselves and in what way rivers influence on the landscape via sediment transport and meandering (Section 2.4).

## 2. Groundwater Flow and Quality
This chapter elaborates on the material presented in chapter 3 of the reader Water 1. In the first part of this chapter a mathematical description will be presented of the shape of the water table under the influence of simple flow patterns. The second part will deal with chemical and ecological aspects of groundwater. Concepts which are assumed known are [[Darcy's Law]], [[Hydraulic Head]] and [[Dupuit Assumptions]].

## 3. Surface Water Quality
This chapter discusses the quality of surface water. As mentioned earlier worldwide less than 1% of the earthâ€™s surface consists of lakes, rivers and other freshwaters. That scarce water has an important function for society. Many human activities dependent on sufficient clean fresh water. On the other side are there many human activities that detrimentally affect the quality of surface water like the increase of nutrients from agriculture and households, pollution from industries and traffic and pesticides from agriculture. To be able to use the water in an optimal way, the water quality has to be managed strictly. In this chapter, first the important aspects of water quality are discussed and the main problems (paragraph 4.2). This is followed by the most important processes that affect water quality (paragraph 4.3). The oxygen balance of fresh water is essential for many chemical and biological processes and for organisms; this will be discussed separately (paragraph 4.4). Then the problems with surplus of nutrients are discussed (paragraph 4.5)  
and micro-pollutants (paragraph 4.6) in surface water. Studying this chapter it will become clear that water quality is not only effected by physical and chemical pollution but also by biological processes. In current water management the chemical, physical and biological aspects of water quality are regarded as linked and studied in coherence. We call this integrated water management.

# ðŸ”— Summaries
Since the literature which the summaries are based on are divided into 3, the summaries have been divided as well.
