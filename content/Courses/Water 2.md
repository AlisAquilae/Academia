# ðŸ”Ž Introduction
The course presents an overview of the role of soil and water in the landscape. Central topic is the  
diversity and coherence in space and time, especially the factors that determine the role of water for human use and nature.

# ðŸ“– Course Material
The literature for this course consists of a reader which has been divided into 3 parts

## Catchment Hydrology
You already learned much about catchments, hydrological processes, the [[Hydrograph]] and the [[Water Balance]] in chapter 2 of the course [[Water 1]]. This chapter continues on that knowledge and we will get deeper into the subject of river discharges. In Section 2.2, you will learn how hydrological models are used to simulate river responses to rain showers. We will especially focus on discharges from surface waters and baseflow (basisafvoer, the slow groundwater flow  
towards the river). Section 2.3 will go deeper into the most important situations: extremes. You will learn how to calculate occurrence probabilities for floods and extreme rainfall, how to use this information for design purposes and how to analyse low flows. Finally, we give you some more information on the streamflow (hydraulics) in the rivers themselves and in what way rivers influence on the landscape via sediment transport and meandering (Section 2.4).
