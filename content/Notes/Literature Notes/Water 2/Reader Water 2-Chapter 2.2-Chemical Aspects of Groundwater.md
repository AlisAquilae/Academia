### 2.2.1 Introduction
Water is essential for the transport of substances, both dissolved and suspended. Needless to say, there is a close connection between quantitative hydrology on one hand and disciplines such as environmental science, biochemistry, agronomy and ecology on the other hand. In this chapter we will introduce the interaction between groundwater flow and the chemical aspects of groundwater

### 2.2.2 Composition and Chemical Genesis of Groundwater

|  | Cations |  |  | Anions |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Name | Symbol | Molecular weight | Name | Symbol | Molecular weight |
| Calcium | $\ce{CA^2+}$ | 40 | Bicarbonate | $\ce{HCO3-}$ | 61 |
| Magnesium | $\ce{Mg^{2+}}$ | 24.5 | Sulphate | $\ce{SO4^{2-}}$ | 96 |
| Sodium | $\ce{Na+}$ | 23 | Chloride | $\ce{Cl^-}$ | 35.5 |
| Potassium | $\ce{K^+}$ | 39 |  |  |  |
The cations and anions given in the table above naturally occur in groundwater. The ratios of these so-called macro-ions changes during the flow process due to oxidation, reduction, weathering, dissolution, precipitation and cation exchange

The [[Electric Conductivity]] (EC) is an easy to measure indicator for the total ion concentration in non-industrial regions. Rainwater is low in ions and in natural composition mainly contains sulphate and sodium ions, Because of air pollution in the Netherlands the concentration of ammonium and sulphate in particular have increased. Ion concentrations in the upper groundwater layer are already higher than in rainwater because of "concentration" as a result of evaporation, since water vapour does not transport ions. 

>[!Important]
>Because the chloride ion ($\ce{Cl^-}$) does not react with other substances and is not adsorbed to soil particles, the ratio between the chloride concentration in rainwater and in the upper groundwater can be used to estimate the actual evaporation. 

At equilibrium the amount of chloride entering the system through precipitation should be discharged through groundwater replenishment. Thus: 

$$
P \times [\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{precipitation}} = (P-E) \times [\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{groundwater}} \tag{3.34}
$$


This can be rewritten as: 

$$
E = p \times \Biggl(1-\frac{[\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{precipitation}}}{[\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{groundwater}}} \Biggr) \tag{3.35} 
$$


>[!Example]
>For example, if rainwater contains 3 mg $\ce{Cl^-}$ per litre and the upper groundwater 9 mg, then the rainwater has been concentrated with a factor of 3; with an annual precipitation of 750 mm the actual evaporation probably was 500 mm. 

A flowing freshwater system is enriched in calcium and bicarbonate ions, primarily because of the dissolution of calcareous (high in calcium) substances present in the sediment.

It is likely that the weathering of limestone (3.37) occurs mainly under the influence of protons ($\ce{H^+}$) formed in the root zone. This is where, through the respiration of roots and micro-organisms, carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$) is produced, which shifts the balance in 3.36 to the right. During the flow process in deeper soil layers increasing amounts of lime are dissolved, increasing the concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate irons while the concentration of $\ce{H^+}$ decreases (i.e. the pH rises). 

This explains the concentrations in "matured" seepage water. The speed of maturing depends on the amount of substances in the sediment that are easily weathered. 

During the flow process many more changes occur in the composition of groundwater. For example, groundwater is often low in oxygen because oxygen has been used in the topsoil during the decomposition of organic material. Because of this relative absence of oxygen $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ can be reduced to $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$. Mature groundwater is often rich in $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$. When this water comes into contact with air in seepage areas the iron oxidises, which can be observed as rust-brown particles floating in the water and attached to plants. Based on these rust phenomena seepage areas can be identified.
