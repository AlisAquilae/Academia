### 2.2.1 Introduction
Water is essential for the transport of substances, both dissolved and suspended. Needless to say, there is a close connection between quantitative hydrology on one hand and disciplines such as environmental science, biochemistry, agronomy and ecology on the other hand. In this chapter we will introduce the interaction between groundwater flow and the chemical aspects of groundwater

| Sodium | $\ce{Na+}$ | 23 | Chloride | $\ce{Cl^-}$ | 35.5 |

The cations and anions given in the table above naturally occur in groundwater. The ratios of these so-called macro-ions changes during the flow process due to oxidation, reduction, weathering, dissolution, precipitation and cation exchange

The [[Electric Conductivity]] (EC) is an easy to measure indicator for the total ion concentration in non-industrial regions. Rainwater is low in ions and in natural composition mainly contains sulphate and sodium ions, Because of air pollution in the Netherlands the concentration of ammonium and sulphate in particular have increased. Ion concentrations in the upper groundwater layer are already higher than in rainwater because of "concentration" as a result of evaporation, since water vapour does not transport ions. 

>[!Important]
>Because the chloride ion ($\ce{Cl^-}$) does not react with other substances and is not adsorbed to soil particles, the ratio between the chloride concentration in rainwater and in the upper groundwater can be used to estimate the actual evaporation. 

At equilibrium the amount of chloride entering the system through precipitation should be discharged through groundwater replenishment. Thus: 

$$
P \times [\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{precipitation}} = (P-E) \times [\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{groundwater}} \tag{3.34}
$$


This can be rewritten as: 

$$
E = p \times \Biggl(1-\frac{[\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{precipitation}}}{[\ce{Cl^-}]_{\text{groundwater}}} \Biggr) \tag{3.35} 
$$


>[!Example]
>For example, if rainwater contains 3 mg $\ce{Cl^-}$ per litre and the upper groundwater 9 mg, then the rainwater has been concentrated with a factor of 3; with an annual precipitation of 750 mm the actual evaporation probably was 500 mm. 

A flowing freshwater system is enriched in calcium and bicarbonate ions, primarily because of the dissolution of calcareous (high in calcium) substances present in the sediment.

\ce{H2O + CO2 <=>> H2CO3 <=>> H^+ + HCO3-} \tag{3.36}

\ce{CaCO3 + H^+ <=>> Ca^{2+} + HCO3-} \tag{3.37} 
> $$

It is likely that the weathering of limestone (3.37) occurs mainly under the influence of protons ($\ce{H^+}$) formed in the root zone. This is where, through the respiration of roots and micro-organisms, carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$) is produced, which shifts the balance in 3.36 to the right. During the flow process in deeper soil layers increasing amounts of lime are dissolved, increasing the concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate irons while the concentration of $\ce{H^+}$ decreases (i.e. the pH rises). 

This explains the concentrations in "matured" seepage water. The speed of maturing depends on the amount of substances in the sediment that are easily weathered. 

During the flow process many more changes occur in the composition of groundwater. For example, groundwater is often low in oxygen because oxygen has been used in the topsoil during the decomposition of organic material. Because of this relative absence of oxygen $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ can be reduced to $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$. Mature groundwater is often rich in $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$. When this water comes into contact with air in seepage areas the iron oxidises, which can be observed as rust-brown particles floating in the water and attached to plants. Based on these rust phenomena seepage areas can be identified.

### 2.2.3 Chemical Profile of Groundwater
There are several ways in which the results of the analyses of macro-ions in groundwater can be presented in such a way that it immediately becomes clear what type of groundwater we are dealing with. Well-known are the methods suggested by Piper, Maucha, Stuifzand and Stiff. By means of an example we will illustrate the latter.

The concentration of macro-ions in the water sample is converted to meq l$^{-1}$. Subsequently the concentration of each ion is converted to its relative contribution to the total concentrations of either cations or anions. These percentages are plotted in a diagram with the cations on the left and the anions on the right.

>[!Missing]
>Insert Fig. 3.14

Below the diagram a bar can be drawn, the length of which is a measure for the total concentration of anions and cations. Normally, the sum of the macro-cations is about the same as that of the macro-anions. Based on the shape of the diagram and the length of the bar the water can be classified as being of a certain type. 

For ecological purposed groundwater can also be classified using the [[Electric Conductivity]] and the ion ratio (IR) according to Van Wirdum: 

$$
IR = \frac{\ce{[Ca^{2+}]}}{\ce{[Ca^{2+}]}+\ce{[Cl^-]}} \tag{3.38} 
$$

The IR indicates the share of calcium ions in the total amount of cations. 

>[!Note]
>The concentrations of IR are in meq l$^{-1}$. For singly charged ions 1 mmol is equal to 1 meq, and for doubly charged ions 1 mmol equals 2 meq

Different samples can be plotted on the diagram, with on the x-axis the EC logarithmically and on the y-axis the IR

>[!Missing]
>Insert Fig. 3.13

In an EC/IR diagram there are always 3 reference points, from three extreme compartments of the hydrological cycle:
1. At = Atmocline water (rainwater)
2. Li = Lithocline water (matured groundwater, rich in calcium and bicarbonate)
3. Th = Thalassocline water (seawater)

>[!Important]
>The idea behind the EC/IR diagram is that the chemical composition of water changes during different stages of the hydrological cycle.

### 2.2.4 Ecohydrology
In ecohydrology we study the interaction between ecosystems and the availability of water. In these interactions the quality of the available water also plays a role. The interactions can occur in bodies of water such as rivers and lakes, or on the land such as in forests or deserts. Here we mainly look at the influence of water quality on Dutch landscapes

The Netherlands is a delta and is characterised by groundwater which is usually close to the surface: on 90% of the land the water table is within 1 m of the surface in winter and 2.5 m in summer. The vegetation has adapted given these wet conditions. 

>[!Note]
>A small part of the Netherlands has deeper water tables, for example the Veluwe and the Peel. 

In addition to the amount of water, each species depends on a specific water quality. Hence, within the landscape we can find different species compositions, which can be explained by differences in hydrological regimes. 

A first classification that explains such differences in species composition is that between infiltration and seepage areas. 

In infiltration areas atmocline rainwater infiltrates with little dissolved substances. Additionally, because of infiltration there is a constant transport of dissolved substances towards the groundwater. This is why infiltration areas are often poor in nutrients and minerals, which shows as the vegetation is adapted to nutrient-poor and acidic conditions. Because of its deep water table infiltration areas are dominated by vegetation adapted to dry conditions, such as winter or spring heather. However, infiltration areas can also have a high water table because of underlying layers which offer resistance, such as in typical gley-podzols (with wet heater) or in raised bogs (with heather and peat moss). 

In seepage areas there is a constant enrichment of dissolved matter. Furthermore,. seepage areas have a high water table which varies little. Hence, the vegetation is characteristic for weakly acid to basic conditions. The nutrient richness varies from poor to extremely rich. In general the nutrient richness increases when:
- the fluctuation in the water table increases (because better aeration leads to higher [[Mineralisation]]), 
- there is an increasing influence of inundation on surface waster, for example from streams
- the soil is increasingly made up of river and sea clay, instead of gravel and sand.

>[!Info]
>Characteristic for nutrient-poor conditions is for example a subtype of Molinia meadows, and for moderately rich soils marsh-marigold lands. Finally, reed and brushwood are characteristic of extremely rich and wet soils, for example in downstream parts of a stream valley. 

>[!Note]
>There are many possible variations on this classification, since the abiotic variation of a landscape depends on geological, geomorphological, soil and hydrological processes  in the location; for example, the vegetation type depends on the quality of seepage water, the influence of parent material, the supply of surface water and the presence of brackish water. Furthermore, the influence of humans on the quality of rain, ground and surface water has an effect on the presence of plant species. 

Despite the wide variety of geological, geomorphological, soil and hydrological processes we can distinguish the Netherlands in several characteristic types:
1. High sandy plains
2. Raised bogs
3. Stream valleys
4. Fens
5. River lands
6. Hilly landscapes
7. Polders
8. Sea clays
9. Coastal areas
10. Urban areas

For some of these landscapes the interaction between water quality and vegetation will be described below.

High sandy plains, i.e. a landscape type with infertile, sandy soils with deep groundwater, can be found for example on the Veluwe. They have a deep water table. are nutrient poort and acidic. A characteristic of vegetation type for this land is dry heather. Previously there were vast fields of heather, but with the introduction of artificial fertilisers around 1900 the surface area strongly declined as a result of land reclamation. What heather is left is overgrown by grass and trees because of the loss of the traditional management practices. Nowadays, efforts are being made to maintain heather by means of grazing with sheep herds, turfing and periodical burning

Raised bogs are under more or less the same conditions as high sandy plains, the difference being that with raised bogs a cover layer of sand has been present. Because of this raised bogs are characterised by extremely wet conditions (up to 90% of a raised bog consists of water). In the past raised bogs were very useful as fuel, which is why very little of this landscape remains in the Netherlands.

### 2.5 Consequences of Over-Fertilisation
Since the fifties of the twentieth century, farmlands in the Netherlands are intensively fertilised, mainly with nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) and sulphate (S) through the application of artificial fertilisers and animal manure. In general, more nutrients were added to the lands than were taken off via crops or livestock. Depending on the weather conditions, manner of application, soil type and hydrological regime a certain amount of the surplus disappears to the groundwater. Hence, high concentrations of nutrients can occur in the upper groundwater under agricultural plots. Especially the high nitrate concentration is a threat to groundwater as a source of drinking water. The amount of nutrients that is leached to the groundwater strongly depends on the height of the water table and the corresponding oxygen-richness. 

In conditions rich in oxygen ammonium is converted into nitrate during the breakdown of organic fertilisers in soils. $$\ce{NH4^+ + 2O2 -> NO3^- + 2H^+ + H2O} \tag{3.39} $$
This process, in which protons are released and thus acidification occurs, is called [[Nitrification]]. Because Dutch farmland is usually well-drained, nitrogen is almost exclusively present as nitrate. However, when there is a shallow water table acidic conditions prevail because the diffusion rate of oxygen is particularly low in water. Under such conditions nitrate is being converted to the harmless nitrogen gas, which disappears into the atmosphere (the atmosphere consists for about80% of nitrogen gas). This nitrogen decomposition process is called [[Denitrification]]: $$\ce{4NO3- + 5CH2O -> 2N2 ^ + H2CO3^- + 2H2O} \tag{3.40} $$
In this equation organic matter is presented in simplified form as $\ce{CH2O}$. Denitrification appears for example after inundation with river water or in wet nature reserves. As a by-product of denitrification, $\ce{N2O}$ (laughing gas) is formed. This is harmful gas because it also contributes to the greenhouse effect. Denitrification has a positive effect on the quality of groundwater, but this process does contribute to another environmental problem. 

To remove nitrate from the groundwater a high water table is desirable. However, the risk of a high water table in periods of high precipitation is that manure is transported into the ditches. Furthermore, a high water table can lead to increased leaching of P towards groundwater under weakly acid to neutral conditions, because iron-phosphate complexes become unstable. 

Drinking water companies are especially worried about excessive nitrate concentrations. The nature of sediment through which the water flows strongly influences whether nitrate is broken down or not. 

In the groundwater nitrate can be reduced by pyrite ($\ce{FeS2}$) or organic matter (Equation 3.40). Marine deposits contain more pyrite than fluvial or glacial deposits. This is correlated with the high sulphate concentration of seawater, which serves as the source of sulphur in the formation of pyrite. In aeolian depositions which are not "buried", such as cover sand, no pyrite is found. In the reduction process of pyrite by nitrate, nitrogen gas is formed again: $$\ce{2FeS2 + 6NO3^- + 4H2O -> 2Fe(OH)3 + 3N2 ^ +4SO4^{2-} + 2H^+} \tag{3.41} $$
This chemical equation (chemical denitrification) is one explanation as to why low nitrate concentrations are often found in the groundwater under fertilised soils containing pyrite, although in combination with high sulphate concentrations and a low pH. In case lime is present, the produced acid can be neutralised (equation 3.37). 

>[!Important]
>Hence, groundwater rich in calcium and sulphate can indicate over-fertilisation. 

The rate of many (bio-)chemical formation and decomposition processes is proportional to the concentrations in the solution. We call this a "linear" reaction, or a "first-order reaction". The rate of chemical denitrification (eq. 3.14) is proportional to the nitrate concentration ($\text{d}C / \text{d}t) \sim C$) and can thus be described as a first-order decomposition process: $$C = C_0e^{- \alpha \, t} \tag{3.42} $$
With:
- $C$ being the nitrate concentration at time $t$ (e.g. mg / l)
- $C_0$ being the nitrate concentration at time $t=0$ (e.g. mg / l)
- $\alpha$ being the decomposition constant (e.g. in yr$^{-1}$)
- $t$ being the time (e.g. in yr)

>[!Note]
>The decomposition constant $\alpha$ depends amongst others on the amount of pyrite in the substrate, especially in deeper layers, and the time for it to be exhausted in the chemical denitrification. Moreover, there is fear for the release of trace elements in the decomposition of pyrite, such as nickel and arsenic. In such a case these trace elements could constitute a threat to water extraction, instead of nitrate. 

Not only drinking water companies are worried about pollution of groundwater with nutrients, nature conservationists have been aware of this problem since the sixties. Nutrients that are applied to agricultural plots can flow to nearby nature reserves through the groundwater. High nutrient concentrations lead highly productive plant species to dominate vegetation. They out-compete species that grow slowly, which are often rare and characteristic species from which nature reserves derive their value. 

Furthermore, there is attention for the questionable role of sulphate in the decline of nature reserves. This sulphate can come directly from fertiliser applications, but also from the decomposition of pyrite under the influence of nitrate (equation 3.41). The reduction of sulphate in wet natural areas, in which oxygen-poor conditions dominate the soil, does not lead to a decrease of its influence such as with nitrate, but on the contrary produces a problem. This is because sulphide (with the characteristic rotten egg odour) is formed, which is already toxic for plant roots at low concentrations: $$\ce{SO4^{2-} + 2CH2O <=>> HS^- + HCO3- + CO2 + H2O} \tag{3.43} $$
A second characteristic of sulphate is that it can be bound strongly to iron, in which case iron sulphides such as $\ce{FeS}$ and $\ce{FeS2}$ (pyrite) are formed. However, iron is the most important factor for the binding of phosphate in most of the wetland soils. Sulphide seriously disrupts the binding of phosphate in all kinds of iron-phosphate complexes and largely consumes newly freed iron. The consequence is "internal" Eutrophication with phosphate: the already present phosphate is freed increasingly fast and "new" phosphate is to a lesser degree bound to iron. 

>[!Important]
>In conclusion: the supply of sulphate-rich water nearly always leads to eutrophication, even when phosphate is completely absent
