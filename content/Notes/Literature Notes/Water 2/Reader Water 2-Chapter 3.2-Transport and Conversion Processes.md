To be able to take efficient measures against water quality problems you have to understand how the concentration of substances are affected by transport and conversion processes. The behaviour and the movement of dissolved substances is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water; this will be discussed in paragraph 3.2.1. The behaviour of suspended material (particles) is determined mainly by sedimentation and resuspension, as can be read in paragraph 3.2.3. Different conversion processes exist: physical processes are discussed in paragraph 3.2.4, chemical processes in paragraph 3.2.5 and biological processes in paragraph 4.2.6.

### 3.2.1 Water Flow and Mixing
The concentration of substances on a certain time and place in the surface water is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water. When the water flows dissolved and suspended elements will be transported. This is called [[Advection]] or **Advective Behaviour**. Also in standing water like lakes and reservoirs local water flows are present leading to a certain mixing of water with material or properties like temperature. Also in running waters like rivers, mixing takes place due to a combination of different flow velocities along the width and the depth caused by turbulence. With turbulence we mean circular movement in the water that occur on different scales. Frictions along interfaces (like banks and bottoms) occur and are visible as whirls behind a boot for instance. This turbulence contributed to the spreading of a pollution that is loaded from the water side. Commonly, those local turbulences and whirls are not analysed separately but the effect can be summarised with the term [[Dispersion]] or **dispersive transport**. Like diffusion this mixing behaviour is described [[Fick's Law]] (which will be explained in continuation courses). Dispersion takes place on a larger scale than diffusion, which is a molecular process ([[Brownian Movement]]). Sometimes it is also important to take into account vertical dispersion (like the transport of warm water in a lake; it floats on colder water). In other cases it is important to study
