To be able to take efficient measures against water quality problems you have to understand how the concentration of substances are affected by transport and conversion processes. The behaviour and the movement of dissolved substances is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water; this will be discussed in paragraph 3.2.1. The behaviour of suspended material (particles) is determined mainly by sedimentation and resuspension, as can be read in paragraph 3.2.3. Different conversion processes exist: physical processes are discussed in paragraph 3.2.4, chemical processes in paragraph 3.2.5 and biological processes in paragraph 4.2.6.

### 3.2.1 Water Flow and Mixing
The concentration of substances on a certain time and place in the surface water is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water. When the water flows dissolved and suspended elements will be transported. This is called [[Advection]] or **Advective Behaviour**. Also in standing water like lakes and reservoirs local water flows are present leading to a certain mixing of water with material or properties like temperature. Also in running waters like rivers, mixing takes place due to a combination of different flow velocities along the width and the depth caused by turbulence. With turbulence we mean circular movement in the water that occur on different scales. Frictions along interfaces (like banks and bottoms) occur and are visible as whirls behind a boot for instance. This turbulence contributed to the spreading of a pollution that is loaded from the water side. Commonly, those local turbulences and whirls are not analysed separately but the effect can be summarised with the term [[Dispersion]] or **dispersive transport**. Like diffusion this mixing behaviour is described [[Fick's Law]] (which will be explained in continuation courses). Dispersion takes place on a larger scale than diffusion, which is a molecular process ([[Brownian Movement]]). Sometimes it is also important to take into account vertical dispersion (like the transport of warm water in a lake; it floats on colder water). In other cases it is important to study suspersion in the longitudinal direction. For example, when an accident happens on the Rhine, and perople want to know when the pollution arrives at an intake point of drinking water. By advection the peak of the concentration will move with the water velocity downstream, and with longitudinal dispersion the profile of the concentration will stretch and flatten out.

### 3.2.2 Lake Stratification
In deep lakes different layers in the water column can be formed especially during the summer period. This is called **Stratification**, and is the result of different temperatures at different depths in the lake. Therefore it is also referred to as **Thermal Stratification**. The top layer is called the **Epilimnion** and is in contact with the atmosphere, so the temperature is high and the layer is mixed due to wind. 

At the bottom there is the **hypolimnion** which is much colder due to lack of incoming light and lack of mixing with he upper layer. In between these two layers there is a, generally small, layer where the temperature decreases quickly: the **metalimnion** or **thermocline**

Clearly the development of stratification is driven by physical processes (changing density of water with different temperature), however, there are important consequences for lake chemistry and ecology as well. In the epilimnion most of the primary production takes place, mainly algae growth. Here the light conditions are good, and temperature is high. Due to primary production and rearation from the atmosphere dissolved oxygen concentration is generally good. In contrast, the hypolimnion is a dark layer where the dissolved oxygen concentration is low and can even be depleted (anoxic). Here organic matter, e.g. sinking of dead algae material from the epilimnion, is decomposed consuming oxygen from the water. Because of absence of primary production and rearation from the atmosphere anoxic conditions can easily exist.

### 3.2.3 Resuspension
Suspended particles have a mahjor role in the turbidity of rivers and lakes. Except algae species that can regulate their floating capacities or can swim, all particles sink to the bottom. **Resuspension** of particles is caused by water movement along the interface water-sediment. This causes a "drag-force" that is also called **Sheer Stress**. Whether the water movement will result in resuspension depends on the flow velocity of the water and the characteristics of the sediment. The minimum force needed for a particle to resuspend is called the **Critical Sheer Stress**. This is different for every particle and is determined by shape, size and mass. The resuspension flux can be described as follows: 

$$ 
\phi_r = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for} \, \tau \le \tau_k \\
C_r \bigl(\frac{\tau}{\tau_k}-1 \bigr), & \text{for} \tau \gt \tau_k
\end{cases}
\tag{3.2}
$$
