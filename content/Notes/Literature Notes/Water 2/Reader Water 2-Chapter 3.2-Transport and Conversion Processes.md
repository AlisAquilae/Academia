To be able to take efficient measures against water quality problems you have to understand how the concentration of substances are affected by transport and conversion processes. The behaviour and the movement of dissolved substances is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water; this will be discussed in paragraph 3.2.1. The behaviour of suspended material (particles) is determined mainly by sedimentation and resuspension, as can be read in paragraph 3.2.3. Different conversion processes exist: physical processes are discussed in paragraph 3.2.4, chemical processes in paragraph 3.2.5 and biological processes in paragraph 4.2.6.

### 3.2.1 Water Flow and Mixing
The concentration of substances on a certain time and place in the surface water is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water. When the water flows dissolved and suspended elements will be transported. This is called [[Advection]] or **Advective Behaviour**. Also in standing water like lakes and reservoirs local water flows are present leading to a certain mixing of water with material or properties like temperature. Also in running waters like rivers, mixing takes place due to a combination of different flow velocities along the width and the depth caused by turbulence. With turbulence we mean circular movement in the water that occur on different scales. Frictions along interfaces (like banks and bottoms) occur and are visible as whirls behind a boot for instance. This turbulence contributed to the spreading of a pollution that is loaded from the water side. Commonly, those local turbulences and whirls are not analysed separately but the effect can be summarised with the term [[Dispersion]] or **dispersive transport**. Like diffusion this mixing behaviour is described [[Fick's Law]] (which will be explained in continuation courses). Dispersion takes place on a larger scale than diffusion, which is a molecular process ([[Brownian Movement]]). Sometimes it is also important to take into account vertical dispersion (like the transport of warm water in a lake; it floats on colder water). In other cases it is important to study suspersion in the longitudinal direction. For example, when an accident happens on the Rhine, and perople want to know when the pollution arrives at an intake point of drinking water. By advection the peak of the concentration will move with the water velocity downstream, and with longitudinal dispersion the profile of the concentration will stretch and flatten out.

### 3.2.2 Lake Stratification
In deep lakes different layers in the water column can be formed especially during the summer period. This is called **Stratification**, and is the result of different temperatures at different depths in the lake. Therefore it is also referred to as **Thermal Stratification**. The top layer is called the **Epilimnion** and is in contact with the atmosphere, so the temperature is high and the layer is mixed due to wind. 

At the bottom there is the **hypolimnion** which is much colder due to lack of incoming light and lack of mixing with he upper layer. In between these two layers there is a, generally small, layer where the temperature decreases quickly: the **metalimnion** or **thermocline**

Clearly the development of stratification is driven by physical processes (changing density of water with different temperature), however, there are important consequences for lake chemistry and ecology as well. In the epilimnion most of the primary production takes place, mainly algae growth. Here the light conditions are good, and temperature is high. Due to primary production and rearation from the atmosphere dissolved oxygen concentration is generally good. In contrast, the hypolimnion is a dark layer where the dissolved oxygen concentration is low and can even be depleted (anoxic). Here organic matter, e.g. sinking of dead algae material from the epilimnion, is decomposed consuming oxygen from the water. Because of absence of primary production and rearation from the atmosphere anoxic conditions can easily exist.

### 3.2.3 Resuspension
Suspended particles have a mahjor role in the turbidity of rivers and lakes. Except algae species that can regulate their floating capacities or can swim, all particles sink to the bottom. **Resuspension** of particles is caused by water movement along the interface water-sediment. This causes a "drag-force" that is also called **Sheer Stress**. Whether the water movement will result in resuspension depends on the flow velocity of the water and the characteristics of the sediment. The minimum force needed for a particle to resuspend is called the **Critical Sheer Stress**. This is different for every particle and is determined by shape, size and mass. The resuspension flux can be described as follows: 

$$ 
\phi_r = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for} \, \tau \le \tau_k \\
C_r \bigl(\frac{\tau}{\tau_k}-1 \bigr), & \text{for} \tau \gt \tau_k
\end{cases}
\tag{3.2}
$$

Where:
- $\phi_r$ is the resuspension flux [g m$^2$ d$^{-1}$] 
- $\tau$ is the shear stress [Pa]
- $\tau_k$ is the critical shear stress [Pa]
- $C_r$ is the resuspension constant [g m$^2$ d$^{-1}$] 

In rivers, streams, etc. water flow is generating the energy for resuspension. In lakes the water movements at the sediment (giving resuspension) are mostly caused by waves, but also fish that search for food in the bottom contribute. Water plants can decrease resuspension by limiting the water flow and stabilising the sediment with their roots. In many shallow likes there is a short cycle for resuspension and settling of sediment and algae. The continuous process of sedimentation and resuspension determines the concentration of suspended material in shallow lakes. The shallower the lake the faster the cycle is finished. When the water of a shallow lake becomes less dynamic for example with a layer of ice, the resuspension decreases strongly and the lake can become clear in a short period of time. In deep lakes there is thermal stratification during summer which reduces the mixing. In such a situation the particles will not get in resuspension easily, once they are settled in the deeper part. In shallow lakes mixing can decrease during summer and the water movement just above the sediment can decrease strongly. This results in sedimentation in a shallow lake. However, when the water movement reaches above a critical limit, for instance because of strong wind, the sediment is resuspended again. 

#### 3.2.3.1 Resuspension by Waves
Waves develop by the friction of wind on water surfaces. The water movement caused by waves is generally complex, but results in horizontal movements along the bottom that can cause resuspension. The shallower the water the stronger the maximum current velocity along the bottom. Resuspension takes place when a critical water movement along the bottom is exceeded. Fine sludge and organic material will be resuspended faster than sand. Moreover, the sediment can consolidate when there is little disturbance or when a layer of bacteria and benthic algae has developed: in such cases resuspension reduces, because the critical water velocity for resuspension increases. 

Although resuspension by waves depends on many factors, it can be predicted with a rather simple rule: resuspension occurs when waves reach the bottom; this might happen if the wavelength is longer than two times the depth of the lake. Generally, the wavelength increases with wind speed. Next to that, the wavelength depends strongly on the **fetch**. This is the length of the water surface on which the wind has impact. This can be observed in small lakes where there is wind. Close to the protected banks the water is calm, but the waves grow with the distance to the open water. 

In general for a lake two characteristics are important for resuspension by waves:
1. The size of the lake. Large lakes have longer fetches and are therefore more susceptible to resuspension
2. The depth of the lake. Deep lakes are less susceptible than shallow lakes, because resuspension occurs when the wavelength is 2 times the depth

#### 3.2.3.2 Resuspension by Fish
In shallow lakes a large part of the fish population eats invertebrates living in and on the sediment like mosquito larvae, snails and worms. Especially bream and carp are known for that. During foraging they ingest the sediment and filter the "benthic invertebrates" out of it. Fine sludge from the bottom will then be resuspended. In lake sediments you can find small craters that are made by foraging fishes, which are called **Benthivorous** fishes. Their resuspension effect can be very large. 

#### 3.2.3.3 The Effect of Water Plants
Water plants decrease resuspension of sediment to a large extent. This can be concluded from some large lakes that were clear till the water plants disappeared and resuspension started with turbid water as a result. Not only submerged water plants but also reed-like plants can decrease resuspension in small lakes. The effect water plants have on reducing sediment resuspension depends on the vegetation density and  structure.

### 3.2.4 Physical Processes of Dissolved and Suspended Material
Mixing and resuspension, as described in the previous section, are physical processes of the water itself. Now we will explain some other important physical processes that influence the substances in the water directly. 

Exchange of substances between the air and thew water (e.g. volatilisation) is important for oxygen, $\ce{CO2}$ and several other volatile pollutants. The ratio between volatilisation and solubility of materials is important for the exchange rate between water and air, next to mixing conditions in the boundary layer. The turbulence in this water layer at the border is determined by the flow velocity, the water depth and the wind. Evaporation of water itself is of great important for the energy balance. 

Sedimentation takes place when particles have a higher density than water. When pollutants are bounded to those particles this results in accumulation in the sediment. Close to the top layer of the sediment the shear stress can be too high and the particles do not settle permanently but concentrate close to the bottom. Therefore a lot of material "rolls" along the bottom of the river downstream. The concentration gradient of particles that develops depends on the ratio between sedimentation and resuspension. 

**Adsorption and Absorption** are physical-chemical processes in which dissolved substances attach to the surface of particles (ad.) or dissolve in those particles (ab.). The attracting forces that cause those attachments are chemical or electrostatic; also important is polarity that determines the solubility of water. Apolar (not polar) organic micro-pollutants like PCB's are poorly soluble in water and tend to attach to organic particles (e.g. detritus). Heavy metals attach mainly to metal oxides but also to organic material. Through the accumulation of pollutants on particles the transport is mainly determined by sedimentation and resuspension, as described earlier. The build-up of pollutants takes place on locations where suspended particles settle like in river floodplains. Especially in urban areas (e.g. harbours) a specific water quality problem occurs: the disposal of polluted sludge and sediment.

### 3.2.5 Chemical Processes
Precipitation occurs when the solubility of hydroxides, carbonates and phosphates etc. are exceeded. In sediments this happens also for sulphides, especially in marine environments. The form,ed minerals of hydroxides are often a mixture with all kinds of irregularities in the crustal structure or even amorphous (lacking a definite geometric or crystalline structure). An often seen precipitate is calcium carbonate that develops through intensive algae growth and an increasing pH. 

Coagulation and flocculation are terms that indicate that colloidal molecules (especially with electric loading) lose their stability and therefore can become "solid" and flocculate. This happens often in the transition zone between salt and fresh water leading to high sedimentation (like in the harbour of Rotterdam). In drinking water treatment coagulation and flocculation is used to remove for instance clay particles. Coagulation can co-occur with adsorption: the small particles often have a reactive surface and therefore they will bind dissolved substances. 

Hydrolysis is the decomposition of chemical bindings by reaction with water. pH is important for that. Sometimes decomposition is activated by light energy, so called photolysis, that op
