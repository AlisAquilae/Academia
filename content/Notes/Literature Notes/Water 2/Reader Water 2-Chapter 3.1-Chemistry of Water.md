### 3.1.1 What is Water Quality?
Really pure water does not exist in nature. There are always substances dissolved or particles that float in the water (suspended matter). The amount and characteristics of dissolved and floating substances determine the "water quality"

Actually, this is a wrong term, as in fact we mean the composition or function of the water. "Quality" is a relative, human concept, meaning the composition of the water related to the function of the water. So, ditches can be of good quality for fishes and water plants, but that does not necessarily mean it can be used for drinking water. Though, water quality is used so often that we will also use it in this chapter to indicate the composition of the water

In surface waters many processes take place that influence the water quality. These processes are mainly related to physical and chemical characteristics of the water. This is in coherence with the structure and the characteristics of water molecules. The water molecule has a high dipole amount and therefore a strong polar character. The strong polar character results in a strong attraction and cohesion between the water molecules, and therefore water at $20 \degree \text{C}$ is a liquid instead of a gas, despite the low molecular weight. We assume that most knowledge related to the physical characteristics are known and in this chapter we will focus on the substances in the water, the chemical composition of surface water and a number of problems that we encounter with surface water.

>[!Important]
>The chemical composition of groundwater and surface water is mainly dependent on the environment that has been in contact with the water.

Even without human interference the composition of natural water can vary enormously. This is the result of contact between groundwater and rocks and soils, of which the composition can vary strongly. During this contact substances dissolve and obviously the timespan of the contact determines which and how much of the substances will dissolve. 

The chemical composition of ther
