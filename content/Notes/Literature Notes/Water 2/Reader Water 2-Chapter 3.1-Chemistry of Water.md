### 3.1.1 What is Water Quality?
Really pure water does not exist in nature. There are always substances dissolved or particles that float in the water (suspended matter). The amount and characteristics of dissolved and floating substances determine the "water quality"

Actually, this is a wrong term, as in fact we mean the composition or function of the water. "Quality" is a relative, human concept, meaning the composition of the water related to the function of the water. So, ditches can be of good quality for fishes and water plants, but that does not necessarily mean it can be used for drinking water. Though, water quality is used so often that we will also use it in this chapter to indicate the composition of the water

In surface waters many processes take place that influence the water quality. These processes are mainly related to physical and chemical characteristics of the water. This is in coherence with the structure and the characteristics of water molecules. The water molecule has a high dipole amount and therefore a strong polar character. The strong polar character results in a strong attraction and cohesion between the water molecules, and therefore water at $20 \degree \text{C}$ is a liquid instead of a gas, despite the low molecular weight. We assume that most knowledge related to the physical characteristics are known and in this chapter we will focus on the substances in the water, the chemical composition of surface water and a number of problems that we encounter with surface water.

>[!Important]
>The chemical composition of groundwater and surface water is mainly dependent on the environment that has been in contact with the water.

Even without human interference the composition of natural water can vary enormously. This is the result of contact between groundwater and rocks and soils, of which the composition can vary strongly. During this contact substances dissolve and obviously the timespan of the contact determines which and how much of the substances will dissolve. The chemical composition of the groundwater is already discussed in paragraph [[Reader Water 2-Chapter 2.2-Chemical Aspects of Groundwater|2.2]]. 

Surface waters are fed by groundwater. Next to that there are interactions with atmosphere, rainfall and evaporation, and input of terrestrial organic matter (e.g. leaves). Also, runoff from soils, erosion and sedimentation are important for the composition of surface waters. However, in many cases processes that take place in the water itself (primary production, chemical reactions) will change the 'natural' composition of water. Next to natural processes the water composition of almost every freshwater on earth is influenced more or less by humans: discharges from sewage systems, both with and without purification of the waste water, leaching nutrients and pesticides, acid rain and other deposits from air pollution, etc. Apart from the dissolved suspended substances, other characteristics can influence the function of water systems. For instance colour, taste and smell, turbidity and radioactivity. 

The different components that are present in surface water in short are:
- **Organic Matter**: This consists of biodegradable organic material, like dead organisms in water and influx from surrounding area like leaves and branches. Roughly it can be separated in floating organic material and dissolved organic material. The organic material is degraded by organisms, finally resulting in $\ce{CO2}$ and water. However, all kind of intermediate substances are produced, like for instance humic acids and fulvic acids. These acids give the water a yellow-brown colour, which often can be found in peatlands and forest lakes. Biodegration of organic material consumes dissolved oxygen from the water. When this happens at large scale the depletion of oxygen can cause problems, like in case of discharge of waste water. 
- **Nutrients**: The most important nutrients in surface waters are nitrogen ($\ce{N}$) and phosphorus ($\ce{P}$). The amount and which nutrient can be found
