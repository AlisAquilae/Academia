### 3.5.1 Some Micropollutants and Toxic Substances
#### 3.5.1.1 Pesticides
Pesticides are used in agriculture and horticultures against diseases, pests and weeds. In the Netherlands yearly 20 million kilo from about 300 different substances are used. These include insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and disinfectants. Though the use of pesticides is more and more controlled, water quality problems still arise, especially around specialised agriculture like flower bulbs. 

#### 3.5.1.2 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) consist of two or more benzine rings, substituted with methyl- or ethyl- groups. They are formed during the (uncompleted) burning of wood, coal or oil. Traffic is therefore one of the most important sources, alongside oil spills and logging of creosoted wood. 

#### 3.5.1.3 Polychlorinated Biphenyls
PCB's are single or multiple chlorinated biphenyls. They are all oily, very stable compounds used as condensators (high dielectric constant), as plasticizers, lubricants and heat exchanger.  They accumulated in fat tissue; biomagnification in the food web is very high. Especially fertility of top predators is damaged and can lead to extinction of animals. The production worldwide and the admission for diverse uses are decreasing.

### 3.5.2 Heavy Metals
Of the heavy metals especially mercury and cadmium are very toxic

#### 3.5.2.1 Mercury
Mercury is present in the environment from chlorine alkali industries, by amalgam from fillings of teeth, batteries, thermometers, etc. and some pesticides. Especially methylated mercury, highly soluble and very mobile can accumulate in fish and is very toxic (nervous poison). Also metallic mercury is toxic. The contamination takes place via the respiratory organs, not via the gastrointestinal channel. 

#### 3.5.2.2 Cadmium
Cadmium is used much in pigments, batteries (with nickel) and in plastics. It is also present in phosphate rock, making fertilisers and their industries important sources. Compared to other heavy metals, cadmium is rather mobile. The concentration in the Rhine area and in the Netherlands have decreased due to a source-related restriction. Due to internal company rules and strict controls the contribution of the industry decreased strongly during the last decades. Though many heavy metals are removed from the sewage at waste water treatment plants, prevention at the source of the pollution is the most effective way for those toxic, not-decomposable substances.
