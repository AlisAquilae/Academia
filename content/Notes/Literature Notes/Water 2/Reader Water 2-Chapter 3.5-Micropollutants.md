### 3.5.1 Some Micropollutants and Toxic Substances
#### 3.5.1.1 Pesticides
Pesticides are used in agriculture and horticultures against diseases, pests and weeds. In the Netherlands yearly 20 million kilo from about 300 different substances are used. These include insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and disinfectants.
