### 3.4.1 Phosphorus Cycle
Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for living organisms for example because it is a component of DNA and ATP. The following figure is a simplified diagram of the P-cycle in fresh water (a lake):

Sediments play an important tole because the mineralisation of settling organic material, algae and dead organisms (detritus), often takes place in the sediment. 

The ability of the sediment to bind phosphorus permanently depends on the chemical composition, the P-load, the presence of seepage or infiltration and oxygen conditions. Often a large part of the sinking P particles are again released as dissolved P, especially during the (late) summer in the growing seasons. 

An important factor for the phosphorus cycle is the influence of redox conditions on the binding of $\ce{PO4}$ to iron ($\ce{Fe}$). This is illustrated in the following figure:

With aerobic conditions $\ce{Fe^2+}$ is oxidised into $\ce{Fe^3+}$. $\ce{Fe(III)PO4}$ is hardly soluble in water and will precipitate. Under anaerobe conditions $\ce{Fe^3+}$ is reduced to $\ce{Fe^2+}$; $\ce{Fe(II)3(PO4)2}$ is well soluble in water and will dissolve as $\ce{Fe^2+}$ and $\ce{PO4^3-}$.

### 3.4.2 The Nitrogen Cycle
Also nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms. Mainly the amino-groups in proteins are responsible for this. Ammonification is the decomposition of dead organic material and amino acids into ammonium. This occurs mainly through heterotrophic organisms, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Nitrification is the process in which ammonium, via nitrite, is converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria. This can only happen under aerobic conditions. The bacteria are chemo-autotrophic organisms, as they get their energy from this conversion. Denitrification, the most important sink in the nitrogen cycle, only takes place in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions). Nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas that disappears into the atmosphere. A small part of nitrate is converted to $\ce{N2O}$, which is a potent greenhouse gas.

In the nitrogen cycle redox conditions are very important. The different processes like ammonification, denitrification and nitrification are partly spatially separated because the presence of oxygen is strongly regulating the processes. 

In the aquatic system anaerobic conditions can be found mainly in the sediment; in deeper lakes and oceans also in the hypolimnion.

### 3.4.3 Load of Nitrogen and Phosphorus to Surface Waters
The loads of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in the Netherlands increased strongly due to agriculture, especially in sandy areas where the phosphate bidding capacity is limited and even exceeded (P-saturated soils). At many places the export of P to surface waters from over-fertilised agricultural land is still limited, though the percentage of saturated land is increasing and worrying. A "front" of high P-levels will be transported via the groundwater and finally reach the surface water; then large problems will arise. Even if we take measures now we will face increasing P loads far into the future because the P is "still on the way". 

For nitrogen the limited absorption in soils increases the tr
