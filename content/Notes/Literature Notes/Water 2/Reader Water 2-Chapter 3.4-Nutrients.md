### 3.4.1 Phosphorus Cycle
Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for living organisms for example because it is a component of DNA and ATP. The following figure is a simplified diagram of the P-cycle in fresh water (a lake):

Sediments play an important tole because the mineralisation of settling organic material, algae and dead organisms (detritus), often takes place in the sediment. 

The ability of the sediment to bind phosphorus permanently depends on the chemical composition, the P-load, the presence of seepage or infiltration and oxygen conditions. Often a large part of the sinking P particles are again released as dissolved P, especially during the (late) summer in the growing seasons. 

An important factor for the phosphorus cycle is the influence of redox conditions on the binding of $\ce{PO4}$ to iron ($\ce{Fe}$). This is illustrated in the following figure:

With aerobic conditions $\ce{Fe^2+}$ is oxidised into $\ce{Fe^3+}$. $\ce{Fe(III)PO4}$ is hardly soluble in water and will precipitate. Under anaerobe conditions $\ce{Fe^3+}$ is reduced to $\ce{Fe^2+}$; $\ce{Fe(II)3(PO4)}
