### 1. Introduction
The [[Catchment]], also called [[Catchment|Basin]], [[Catchment|Drainage Basin]] or [[Catchment|Watershed]]) of a river is the area from which excess water flows towards that river. 

Every catchment has characteristics which determine the hydrological processes that occur. When these characteristics change, for example when urbanisation increases the percentage of paved surfaces or when forests are removed, different processes may occur, leading to higher or lower discharges in the river. 

This section introduces catchments and the three most important landscape characteristics:
1. Topography
2. Land cover
3. Geology

In [[Reader Water 1-Chapter 1.4-Rainfall-Runoff Processes|Section 1.4]] these landscape characteristics are linked to hydrological processes.

### 2. Catchment Delineation
While not specified, the catchment of a river or stream is the area draining towards the river's outlet (or **[[Debouchment]]**), which is at the sea or when the river joins a larger river. 

>[!Note]
>The catchment can also be defined upstream of a measurement station or any point of interest (city, nature area, etc.)

Determining the catchment boundary (or [[Water Divide]]) is called [[Catchment Delineation]] and can be done in several ways

1. **The Surface Water Divide** is found by following the river channels upstream until their sources and drawing the divide between the channels leading to the outlet and the channels leading to another river. 
2. **The Topographical Water Divide** is found by looking at the topography of the area. This is based on the idea that water follows the highest points in the landscape. This can, however, deviate from the actual water divide, because infiltrating water may hit an impermeable layer in the ground and be led in another direction.
3. **The Groundwater Divide** looks at groundwater flows, and therefore focuses on geological characteristics. The difference between the topographical water divide and the actual water divide is often caused by groundwater, and is therefore least accurate in catchments with a high contribution of groundwater flows. 

>[!Note]
>In many places, people have changed the course of groundwater and surface water flow, changing the catchment boundary. For example, the catchment boundaries of polders are often dikes.

### 3. Zones
When going downstream, water of an increasing area is discharged: the catchment extent increases in the downstream direction. 

In general, we can divide the catchment area of a river, from source to outlet, in 3 [[Catchment Zoning|zones]]:
1. Zone 1 is the **upper course** or upstream area, which consists of various sub-catchments with a dense dendritic (tree-shaped) network of channels. We call this area the [[Production Zone]], because this is the main region where the surface water and sediments are formed. 
2. Zone 2 is the **middle course**, which consists of a distinguished main channel which often meanders through the landscape. This main channel only has a few branches. We call this area the [[Transport Zone]] because sediment is transported downstream.
3. Zone 3 is the **lower course** or downstream area. This is the delta where the river divides into multiple branches again as a result of the flat landscape, and as a result of the large amount of water and sediment present in the river. We call this area the [[Deposition Zone]], because the low flow velocity causes sediment to settle

### 4. Topography
The topography (variation in elevation) plays an important role in the formation and transport of surface water. The appearance of the current channels in (mostly) natural catchments is the result of erosion and sedimentation which have taken place over thousands of years, under the influence of the past and present climate. 

Topography determines partly which areas within a catchment are relatively wet and vulnerable to flooding. The [[Draining Area]] of a certain point in the landscape is the surface water uphill (above that point and up to the water divide) because water from that area all flows towards that point. If the draining area is large, a large amount of water has to pass by this point, increasing the wetness (and flood risk). Similarly, if the slope of the land surface at that point is high, the water flows quickly, reducing wetness and flood risk. 

The ratio between the draining area and the local slope is called the [[Topographic Wetness Index]]. At locations with a high topographic wetness index, ponds form and channels begin. 

Hillslopes can be classified based on their shape and slope.
- A hillslope shaped like a funnel is known as a **converging hillslope**, because all water is led to one point
- A **diverging hillslope** spread the water out more, leading to a generally less wet area
- A **parallel hillslope** is neither converging nor diverging
- **Straight hillslopes** have the same slope everywhere
- **Concave hillslopes** (shaped like a hollow) have higher slopes at the top and lower at the bottom, which increases the wetness and flood risk at the bottom
- **Convex hillslopes** (rounded) have lower slopes near the top and higher near the bottom, decreasing the wetness at the bottom.

### 5. Land Cover
Most of the land surface is covered by vegetation, either natural or planted. The presence and type of vegetation impact hydrological processes. Leaves intercept rain water, roots extract water from the ground and water can seep into the ground more easily near stems. Areas that are intensively used by people often have additional means to discharge excess water (such as drainpipes, ditches and sewage systems). Therefore, information how the land is used helps to predict which hydrological processes occur and how discharge responds to rainfall

### 6. Geology
The subsurface plays a major role in storing and transporting water in catchments. The properties of the soil or rocks determine how much water can be stored and how fast water will flow underground.

For catchment hydrology, the major soil properties are [[Porosity]] and conductivity (also called [[Permeability]]).

The [[Porosity]] is the fraction of open spaces between soil particles and determines how much water can be stored in the ground. 

The [[Permeability]] is a measure of how easy it is for the water to flow between soil particles and determines how quickly water is transported

>[!note]
>Both are explained in more detail later on in the reader

Porosity and conductivity are determines by the size, shape and origin of the soil particles.
- **Gravel** (very large particles) has a very high conductivity
- **Sand** (large particles) has a high conductivity
- **Clay** (small particles) has a low conductivity

The porosity is highest for clay and lowest for gravel, but the differences between soil types are less distinct than for the conductivity. 

>[!Important]
>While both [[Porosity]] and [[Permeability]] influence the ability of water to move through a soil, they do not necessarily move hand in hand. There might be spaces between soil particles, indicating that the porosity is high, but these spaces do not have to be connected. This is the case in, for example, clay sheets. Another example is peat, which has a very high porosity but a low conductivity because it consists of partly composed plant material which fixates water

Soil particles were deposited under certain environmental conditions in the past, which is now visible in layers of varying soil types. A layer of permeable soil is called an [[Aquifer]] and can store and transport water well. Under the layer(s) of soil (loose material) is the bedrock (solid rocks). In mountainous areas, the soil can be just a thin layer or completely absent and the soil depth (or depth to bedrock) is an important factor for determining a catchment's response to rainfall. 

>[!Note]
>Water can be stored in rocks and flow through it, but the permeability and conductivity are often low, unless there are cracks.

>[!Note]
>In lowland areas the bedrock can be hundreds of meters deep and does not affect hydrology
