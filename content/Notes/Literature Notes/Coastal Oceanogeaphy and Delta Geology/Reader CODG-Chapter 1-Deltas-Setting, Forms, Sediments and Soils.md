# 1.1 What is a Delta?
The term [[Delta]] refers to the roughly triangular shape of the land enclosed by two river branches and the coastline, which resembles the Greek letter $\Delta$. The origin of such a piece of coastal land is a subject of study for geologists and geomorphologists.

Key to this origin is the fact that where a river debouches into a sea or lake, the sediments carried by the river are deposited near the mouth, because of the more or less sudden reduction of the ability of the flow to carry sediments. Over time, a particularly submerged, seaw
