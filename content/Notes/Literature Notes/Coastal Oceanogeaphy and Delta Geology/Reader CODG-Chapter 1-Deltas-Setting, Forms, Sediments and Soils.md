# 1.1 What is a Delta?
The term [[Delta]] refers to the roughly triangular shape of the land enclosed by two river branches and the coastline, which resembles the Greek letter $\Delta$. The origin of such a piece of coastal land is a subject of study for geologists and geomorphologists.

Key to this origin is the fact that where a river debouches into a sea or lake, the sediments carried by the river are deposited near the mouth, because of the more or less sudden reduction of the ability of the flow to carry sediments. Over time, a particularly submerged, seaward growing sediment body is formed near the river mouth. Starting from this depositional process, geologists and geomorphologists have a slightly different focus when studying the delta phenomenon

In the geological sense, the sediment body, of which only a relatively small portion is visible at the surface, is called a delta. Thus, geological delta studies place emphasis on three-dimensional characteristics, such as variations in grain size of the deposits, their stratigraphy and possible (tectonic) deformations. Delta sediment bodies are also called coastal prisms: wedge-formed sediment bodies (when viewed in a cross-section perpendicular to the coastline) formed on a sloping surface near sea (or lake) level. 

Geomorphologically, a delta is considered as a landform, thereby excluding the deep subsurface and far offshore parts of the delta sediment body. In the geomorphological sense a delta can be considered as a part of the coastal plain formed under influence of rivers meeting the sea or lake. This plain is formed by fluvial deposition, but also by near-shore redistribution of sediments supplied by the river under influence of marine or lacustrine and eolian processes. A geomorphological definition of deltas can be based on the existence of multiple active and abandoned distributary river channels on the delta plain. On a natural delta plain the river is not confined by valley slopes (or embankments) and will change its course from time to time, with new distributaries creating new delta lobes on the coastline. In the process of switching, which is called [[Avulsion]], multiple active distributaries may coexist for some time, although often delta river discharge is captured by one dominant channel, leaving the earlier channel as a remnant on the delta plain. 

>[!Important]
>Because of this typical deltaic process of channel switching, deltas can be defined geomorphologically to include the radial complex of active and abandoned distributary channels with associated fluvial landforms and the enclosed portions of the coastal plain, which forms where a river meets the sea or a lake. 

Defined as such, neighbouring parts of the coastal plain without landforms created by the delta river are excluded from the delta, as well as offshore areas and uplands that are above present river flood levels. 

>[!Important]
>The most landward point of the delta (the apex) is defined by the most upstream occurrence of (abandoned) distributaries splitting from the main channel without rejoining it downstream. Often this is the point where the river leaves a more or less confined valley setting. 

Because this course is about the deltaic environment as a space for human activities, we will focus on the geomorphological aspects of deltas, and therefore the geomorphological definition above will be used as an anchor point. However, for full understanding of delta geomorphology, geological knowledge remains indispensable, and therefore in the next sections we will discuss the geological framework of delta formation. For the same reason, in this course we will also pay attention to the delta-building processes in the shallow offshore zone, i.e. outside the geomorphological delta proper, because they help us understand geomorphological characteristics. Although deltas can form in both seas and lakes, in this course the case of lake deltas will not be addressed. 

It is important to realize that deltas are the ultimate product of hydraulic forces moving sediment particles from one place to another. These hydraulic forces, which are generated by fluvial, tidal and wave processes, will be addressed in depth in the hydrological part of this course. The three main categories of delta-forming forces also serve as a basis for distinguishing geomorphological delta types that we will expand upon after having outlined the geological context of delta formation

# 1.2 The Geological Setting of Deltas
Deltas usually build out on a relatively flat and shallow part of the seafloor, called the **continental shelf**. A wide continental shelf means that deltas can, relatively rapidly, grow seaward for a considerable distance. When approaching the deeper waters near the shelf edge, seaward extension of a delta slows down because the volume of sediments needed for subaerial delta growth then strongly increases.

What is needed for a large delta to form?
1. *A large river system delivering a lot of sediment*: Such river systems usually have a large catchment and drain major parts of the continent. Obviously, large rivers also require high participation over the catchment, which is especially the case in (monsoonal) tropical climates. Additionally, sediment production in the catchment is strongly enhanced if the catchment has a high relief with strong mechanical weathering in large high altitude areas. Also tectonic activity may contribute to high sediment production. Given these factors, it cannot be a surprise that the largest delta in the world is the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. This delta is formed by mega-rivers that drain the tectonically active Himalayas. Moreover, the catchment is subjected to very high precipitation in a tropical monsoonal climate
2. *A shallow sea, i.e. a wide continental shelf*: Deltas form on the margins of continents. These margins can be either geologically active or passive. Active continental margins are characterized by deep-sea troughs where seafloor (oceanic plate) dips under the continent (continental plate) in a process called **subduction**. In this situation the bottom of the sea slopes steeply from the coast to the deep sea and there is no substantial continental shelf that can host a large delta. Passive continental margins, on the other hand, are characterized by a (wide) continental shelf, which actually is the submerged part of the continent, and absence of a subduction zone. Large deltas tend to form in tec
