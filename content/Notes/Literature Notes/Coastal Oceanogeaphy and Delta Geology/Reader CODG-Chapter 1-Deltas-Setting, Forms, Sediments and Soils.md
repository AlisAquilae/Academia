# 1.1 What is a Delta?
The term [[Delta]] refers to the roughly triangular shape of the land enclosed by two river branches and the coastline, which resembles the Greek letter $\Delta$. The origin of such a piece of coastal land is a subject of study for geologists and geomorphologists.

Key to this origin is the fact that where a river debouches into a sea or lake, the sediments carried by the river are deposited near the mouth, because of the more or less sudden reduction of the ability of the flow to carry sediments. Over time, a particularly submerged, seaward growing sediment body is formed near the river mouth. Starting from this depositional process, geologists and geomorphologists have a slightly different focus when studying the delta phenomenon

In the geological sense, the sediment body, of which only a relatively small portion is visible at the surface, is called a delta. Thus, geological delta studies place emphasis on three-dimensional characteristics, such as variations in grain size of the deposits, their stratigraphy and possible (tectonic) deformations. Delta sediment bodies are also called coastal prisms: wedge-formed sediment bodies (when viewed in a cross-section perpendicular to the coastline) formed on a sloping surface near sea (or lake) level. 

Geomorphologically, a delta is considered as a landform, thereby excluding the deep subsurface and far offshore parts of the delta sediment body. In the geomorphological sense a delta can be considered as a part of the coastal plain formed under influence of rivers meeting the sea or lake. This plain is formed by fluvial deposition, but also by near-shore redistribution of sediments supplied by the river under influence of marine or lacustrine and eolian processes. A geomorphological definition of deltas can be based on the existence of multiple active and abandoned distributary river channels on the delta plain. On a natural delta plain the river is not confined by valley slopes (or embankments) and will change its course from time to time, with new distributaries creating new delta lobes on the coastline. In the process of switching, which is called [[Avulsion]], multiple active distributaries may coexist for some time, although often delta river discharge is captured by one dominant channel, leaving the earlier channel as a remnant on the delta plain.

>Because of this typical deltaic process of channel switching, deltas can be defined geomorphologically to include the radial complex of active and abandoned distributary channels with associated fluvial landforms and the enclosed portions of the coastal plain, which forms where a river meets the sea or a lake. 

Defined as such, neighbouring parts of the coastal plain without landforms created by the delta river are excluded from the delta, as well as offshore areas and uplands that are above present river flood levels. 

>[!Important]
>The most landward point of the delta (the apex) is defined by the most upstream occurrence of (abandoned) distributaries splitting from the main channel without rejoining it downstream. Often this is the point where the river leaves a more or less confined valley setting. 

Because this course is about the deltaic environment as a space for human activities, we will focus on the geomorphological aspects of deltas, and therefore the geomorphological definition above will be used as an anchor point. However, for full understanding of delta geomorphology
