### 8.1 Extreme Values
#### 8.1.1 Introduction: Functions of One Variable
In [[Mathematics that Works 2-Chapter 1-Functions and their Derivatives#1.4 The Derivative|Chapter 1.4]] we discussed the concepts of stationary point, maximum and minimum for functions of one variable. The function $f(x)$ has a maximum at $x=a$ if the graph of $f(x)$ lies below $f(a)$ in a neighbourhood of $x=a$. 

For a smooth function $f(x)$, a point where the function attains a maximum (or minimum) is always a stationary point, that is a point $x=a$ where the tangent line to $f(x)$ is horizontal; so, $f'(a)=0$. The second derivative test can be used to decide whether $f(x)$ has a maximum in the stationary point $x=a$
