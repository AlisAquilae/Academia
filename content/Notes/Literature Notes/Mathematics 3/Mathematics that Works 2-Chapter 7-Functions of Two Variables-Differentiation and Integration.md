### 7.1 Graph and Tangent Plant
In this chapter we study functions of two variables. We make computations in $R^2$ and $R^3$. To keep the notation simple we indicate the coordinates of a point by $x$ and $y$ (and $z$). Note that the results of this chapter can readily be generalised to functions of $n$ variables

#### 7.1.1 Functions of One Variable: Graph and Tangent Line
For every number $x$, a function $f(x)$ determines a number $y=f(x)$. The points $(x, f(x))$ in the $(x,y)$-plane together form the graph of $f(x)$. This graph is a curve in the $(x,y)$-plane with equation $y=f(x)$. To every $x$ belongs exactly one value of $y$; $x$ is called the independent variable and $y$ the dependent variable

In [[Mathematics that Works 2-Chapter 3-Change and Growth#3.1 Derivative and Change|Chapter 3.1]] we derived a linear approximation of a function $f(x)$ of a single variable

$$
f(x) \cong f(a)+ f'(a)(x-a)
$$

The graph of this function at the right hand side is the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Therefore, an equation for the tangent line is 

$$
y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)
$$

Thus we approximate the change in $y$ along the graph from $a$ to $x$ by change along the tangent line of the graph.

#### 7.1.2 Functions of Two Variables: Graph and Tangent Line
A function $f(x,y)$ of two variables determines for every set of two real numbers $x$ and $y$, a number $z=f(x,y)$

>[!Example]
>$f(x,y)=2x-y$ is an example of a function of two variables. Check that $f(2,1)=3$

Together, the points $(x,y,f(x,y))$ in the $(x,y,z)$-space form the graph of $f(x,y)$. This graph is a (curved) surface with equation $z=f(x,y)$. To every point $(x,y)$ in the base plane belongs exactly one point $(x,y,f(x,y))$ on the graph; the variables $x$ and $y$ are the independent variables and $z$ is the dependent variable. 

The point $P=(a,b,f(a,b))$ lies on the graph, above the point $Q=(a,b)$ in the base plane. Two tangent lines of $f(x,y)$ through $P$ are $RS$, parallel to the $(x,z)$-plane, and $TU$, parallel to the $(y,z)$-plane. The plane $XYZ$ spanned by these lines contains al
