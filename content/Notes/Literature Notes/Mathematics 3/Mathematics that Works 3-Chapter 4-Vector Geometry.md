### 4.1 Angels and Distances
#### 4.1.1 Inner Product
In vector geometry, the length of a vector and the angle between two vectors are fundamental concepts. The key to express angle and length in terms of the coordinates of the vector(s) is the **inner product**

For any two vectors $x$ and $y$ in $R^2$,

$$
x=
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\ x_2
\end{pmatrix}
, y=
\begin{pmatrti}
$$
