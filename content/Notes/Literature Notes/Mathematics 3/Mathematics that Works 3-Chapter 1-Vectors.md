### 2.1 Solving Systems of Linear Equations Systematically

#### 2.1.1 Systems of Linear Equations
Assume the following linear equation with two unknowns, $x$ and $y$

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0.80x + 0.10y &= 30 \\
0.10x + 0.70y &= 45 \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

When we multiply the second equation by 8, we obtain

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0.80x + 0.10y &= 30 \\
0.80x + 5.60y &= 360 \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

Now we subtract the upper equation from the lower one

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0.80x + 0.10y &= 30 \\
0x + 5.50y &= 330 \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

After dividing the second equation by $5.50$ we find $y=60$. We use this result in the first equation to obtain $0.80x + 6 = 30 \Rightarrow 0.80x = 24 \Rightarrow x=30$

The solutions of the equation $0.80x + 0.10y = 30$ form a straight line in the (x,y)-plane (because $y=-8x + 300$). Hence, this equation is called a **Linear Equation**. 

In an equation of the form 

$$
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = b
$$

is a linear equation in the $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. The numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ are called the **coefficients** of the equation, and the number $b$ is the **inhomogeoneous term**

#### 1.2 Elimination and Substitution
The solution process of many mathematical problems and applications involves solving a system of linear equations. To guarantee that one finds all solution, it is essential to proceed in a systematic way.

Consider the following two systems of equations with **unknowns** $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1\alpha + 1\beta -1\gamma = 1 \\

\end{array}
\right.
$$
