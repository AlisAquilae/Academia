# 2.2 Time-Invariant Scalar Differential Equations
## 2.2.1 Separation of Variables

>[!Example]
>We look for the solution $x(t)$ of the initial value problem
>
>$$
>x'(t) = kx(t), x(0)=2
>$$
>
>**Step 1**: We bring the factor $x(t)$ to the left hand side of the equation, which is realised by dividing the differential equation left and right by $x(t)$. The result is
>
>$$
>\frac{1}{x(t)}x'(t)=k
>$$
>
>**Step 2**: We integrate left and right with respect to $t$
>
>$$
>\int \frac{1}{x(t)} x'(t)dt = \int k dt
>$$
>
>**Step 3**: In the integral on the left, we exchange
