# 1.1 Introduction
Often, a quantity depends on more than one variable. In this chapter, we consider functions of two variables but most results also apply to functions of more than two variables.

# 1.2 Partial Derivatives and Linear Approximations
In this chapter we discuss differentiation of functions of two variables. We make computations in $R^2$ (and $R^3$). To keep the notation simple, we indicate the coordinates of a point in $R^2$ (or $R^3$) by $x$ and $y$ (or by $x$, $y$ and $z$) instead of $x_1$ and $x_2$ (or $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$). However, the results of this chapter can easily be generalised to functions of $n$ variables. 

## 1.2.1 Functions of One Variable: Graph and Tangent Line
For every number $x$, a function $f(x)$ determines a number $y=f(x)$. The point $(x, f(x))$ in
