# 1.1 Introduction
Often, a quantity depends on more than one variable. In this chapter, we consider functions of two variables but most results also apply to functions of more than two variables.

# 1.2 Partial Derivatives and Linear Approximations
In this chapter we discuss differentiation of functions of two variables. We make computations in $R^2$ (and $R^3$). To keep the notation simple, we indicate the coordinates of a point in $R^2$ (or $R^3$) by $x$ and $y$ (or by $x$, $y$ and $z$) instead of $x_1$ and $x_2$ (or $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$). However, the results of this chapter can easily be generalised to functions of $n$ variables. 

## 1.2.1 Functions of One Variable: Graph and Tangent Line
For every number $x$, a function $f(x)$ determines a number $y=f(x)$. The points $(x, f(x))$ in the $(x, y)$-plane together form the graph of $f(x)$. This graph is a curve in the $(x, y)$-plane with equation $y = f(x)$. To every $x$ belongs exactly one value of $y$; $x$ is called the independent and y the dependent variable.

A linear approximation of a function $f(x)$ about $x=a$ is

$$
f(x) \cong f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
$$

The graph of the function at the right hand side is the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Thus, an equation for the tangent line of $f(x)$ in $x=a$ is

$$
y = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
$$

## 1.2.2 Functions of Two Variables: Graph and Tangent Plane
A function $f(x, y)$ of two variables determines for every two real numbers $x$ and $y$ a number $z = f(x,y)$

The points $(x, y, f(x, y))$ in the $(x, y, z)$-space form together the graph of $f(x, y)$. This graph is a (curved) surface with the equation $z = f(x,y)$. To every point $(x,y)$ in the base plane belongs exactly one point $(x,y,f(x,y))$ on the graph; the variables $x$ and $y$ are the independent variables and $z$ is the dependent variable. A part of the graph of such a function is depicted below
