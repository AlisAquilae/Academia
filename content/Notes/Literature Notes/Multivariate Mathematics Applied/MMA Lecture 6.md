# Basic Properties of integrals
Integrating the function 1 yields the size of the integration domain. If I want to know the volume of a part of a sphere, integrate the function 1 over that sphere's domain

If the integrand $f$ does not depend on the integration variable, the outcome of that integral is a multiple of the integrand: $c \cdot f$, where $c$ is the length of the integration interval.
