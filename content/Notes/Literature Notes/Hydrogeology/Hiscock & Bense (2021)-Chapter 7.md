# 7.1 Introduction
This chapter described the field methods that are applied in hydrogeological investigations. The measurement of groundwater levels and the presentation and interpretation of borehole hydrographs and groundwater level contour maps are first introduced. Next, field methods such as piezometer and pumping tests for the estimation of the aquifer properties of transmissivity and storativity are described. The application of tracer techniques in groundwater resources investigations are covered, together with an introduction to the application of geophysical methods, remote sensing techniques and numerical groundwater flow and solute transport modelling in hydrogeology

# 7.2 Measurement and Interpretation of Groundwater Level Data

The measurement and collection of groundwater level data are of fundamental importance in hydrogeology. Groundwater level data for an aquifer unit can be used for several purposes including plotting a hydrograph, determining the direction of groundwater flow by constructing a map of the potentiometric surface, and in completing a flow net. Values of hydraulic head are also essential in the process of designing and testing a numerical groundwater flow model for the purpose of making predictions of aquifer behaviour under future conditions.

## 7.2.1 Water Level Measurement
Measurement of groundwater level in the field is undertaken using either a water level dipper or by use of a submersible pressure transducer positioned just below the lowest expected groundwater level. The required field measurement is the depth from a convenient measurement datum, for example the well top or borehole flange, to the position of the groundwater level. If the elevation of the measurement datum is known from levelling techniques, then the elevation of the groundwater level (or groundwater head, $h$) can be recorded as the height above or below a local base level, typically mean sea level (MSL).

A water level dipper for use in the field comprises a length of twin-core cable, graduated in centimetres and metres, wound on to a drum and with a pair of electrodes attached to the end (Fig. 7.1). When the electrodes touch the water surface, a circuit is completed which activates either a light or a buzzer or both.

Groundwater levels are measured in either a well (Fig. 7.2a) or a purpose-built observation borehole (Fig. 7.2b). Wells are typically shallow in depth, lined with unmortared bricks and penetrate the top of the local water table in an unconfined aquifer. Observation boreholes can either be uncased (open) or cased, depending on the strength of the aquifer rock, and record the groundwater level in unconfined aquifers (for which there is a water table) or confined aquifers (for which there exists a potentiometric surface).

A special type of installation known as a piezometer (Fig. 7.2c) is designed to provide a measurement of the hydraulic head at a given depth in an aquifer. A bundle of piezometers nested in a single borehole installation can provide information on hydraulic heads at several depths in an aquifer from which the vertical component of groundwater flow, either downwards in a recharge area or upwards in a discharge zone, can be ascertained.

## 7.2.2 Well and Borehole Design and Construction Methods
Traditionally, boreholes are drilled with either an auger rig or, more usually, a percussion or rotary rig. Percussion drilling is used most often at shallow depths, while rotary methods predominate in the construction of deep boreholes and wells. 

### 7.2.2.1 Auger Drilling
Auger rigs vary from small-diameter manual augers for soil sampling to large truck- or crane-mounted augers used for drilling shafts that are more than a metre in diameter. The most common auger design is the screw auger, with a blade welded in a continuous spiral to a central solid shaft, usually supplied in 1-m sections. In continuous flight augering, drilling progresses by screwing the auger into the ground for one auger section, and then withdrawing the auger. Another section is then added to the flight and the auger lowered to the bottom of the hole.

>. The samples of material recovered by ordinary augering are held on the blades of the auger but are disturbed. Undisturbed core samples for core logging can be obtained by hollow-stem augering. The mechanics of the drilling are identical, but with the hollow-stem auger the spiral blade is welded to a tube. As augering progresses, a core of sediment is forced into the tube or hollow stem, to be recovered when the augers are withdrawn

Auger drilling is suitable for rapid formation sampling at shallow depths, or even for drilling small observation boreholes provided that the formation is soft and cohesive. Augering is not possible in hard rocks, dry sands or in gravels for which other methods are required. Below the water table, penetration by the auger may be impossible because of formation collapse.

### 7.2.2.2 Percussion Drilling
Compared to auger drilling, percussion drilling is suited to shale, indurated sandstone and limestone, and even to slate, basalt or granite, although progress is slow in these harder rocks. A heavy, solid-steel chisel-bit is suspended by a steel cable (cable-tool drilling) from a tripod or derrick, and dropped repeatedly. Once a certain amount of rock has been pulverized, a separate bit, known as the bailer, and comprising a length of heavy-duty steel tube with a clack-valve set into its lower end, is lowered down the borehole to remove the debris, usually with the addition of water to loosen and collect the cuttings.

A special tool is used for percussion drilling in soft, unstable formations such as clays and granular material. A steel tube or shell, either plain or with windows cut in the side to help sample removal, is employed with a cutting shoe at the bottom. The top end of the shell is open and is very similar in design and appearance to a normal bailer (Fig. 7.2d).

Another difference between percussion drilling in unstable formations and hard rocks is that the former need support during drilling, and this means that temporary casing of sufficient diameter is needed to allow the string of permanent casing/screen to pass inside it on completion of the borehole.

### 7.2.2.3 Rotary Drilling
Rotary drilling overcomes the problem of having to use temporary casing by using the hydrostatic pressure of circulating fluids to support the borehole wall. The use of drilling fluids enables boreholes to be drilled to much greater depths than with percussion rigs. 

Rotary rigs are divided into two types: direct circulation and reverse circulation, depending on the method used to circulate the drilling fluid. The drill string comprises lengths of heavy-duty steel tubing or drill pipe, with the drill bit assembly attached at the bottom. The design of the drill bit depends on the formation to be drilled. In soft formations, a simple drag bit equipped with hardened blades can use used. The commonest rotary bit is the tricone bit which has three hardened steel, toothed conical cutters which can rotate on bearings. The drilling fluid passes through ports which are placed to clean and cool the teeth as well as carry away the cuttings. The teeth on the cutters vary in size and number to suit the formation being drilled, with small, numerous teeth for hard formations and larger teeth for softer formations. The drilling fluid used can be clean water, if the formations are hard and competent, but the most common general-purpose drilling fluid for sediments is mud based on natural bentonite clay. 

>[!Info]
>A good bentonite mud will have a specific gravity of 1.2.

In direct circulation rotary drilling, the mud, which is a suspension of clay in water, is under the hydrostatic pressure of the column of mud in the borehole and is forced from suspension into the adjacent formations. The water leaves the clay behind as a layer or cake attached to the borehole wall. Bentonite-based mud has some important disadvantages for drilling water wells. The mud-cake can be securely keyed to the porous formation such that it is difficult to remove during well development. Alternatives to bentonite include organic polymers, foam and compressed air.

In reverse circulation rotary drilling, the drilling fluid is usually water which is pulled up the drill pipe by a centrifugal pump commonly aided by airlift. The reverse circulation system enables the drilling of large-diameter boreholes in loose formations and is based on the ability of the borehole walls to be supported by the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the water column and the positive flow of water from the borehole to the formations

## 7.2.3 Borehole Hydrographs and Barometric Efficiency

Well or borehole hydrographs typically display data collected at monthly intervals, or at shorter (say 30-min) intervals if collected with a pressure transducer, and provide a record of fluctuations in groundwater levels.

As shown in Fig. 7.3, additional data can be shown on a hydrograph to indicate the position of measured monthly groundwater levels relative to the long-term average and to historic minima and maxima.

Long-term records are invaluable. Climatic effects such as the frequency of wet and dry years can be identified as well as artificial effects, for example the over-exploitation of groundwater resources leading to a gradual decline in groundwater level (see Fig. 7.3b).

## 7.2.4 Construction of Groundwater Level Contour Maps
To be able to construct a map of the groundwater level and therefore depict the potentiometric surface and determine the direction of groundwater flow, a minimum of three observation points is required as shown in Fig. 7.7. The procedure is first to relate the field groundwater levels to a common datum (map datum or sea level for convenience) and then plot the positions of the observation points on a scale plan. Next, lines are drawn between three groundwater level measurements and divided into a number of short, equal lengths in proportion to the difference in elevation at each end of the line (in the example shown, each division on line AB and BC is 0.2m, while on line AC each division is 0.1m). The next step is to join points of equal elevation on each of the lines and then to select a contour interval which is appropriate to the overall variation in water levels in the mapped area (here 0.5m). The same procedure is followed for other pairs of field observation points until one or two key contour lines can be mapped. At this point, the remaining contour lines can be drawn by interpolating between the field values.

Additional information that can be used in completing a potentiometric surface map is knowledge of the general topography of a region, and records of the elevations of springs known to discharge from an aquifer as well as the elevations of gaining streams and rivers that flow over the aquifer outcrop since these points represent ground surface interception of the water table. For unconfined aquifers bordering the sea it is usual to represent the coastline as a groundwater contour with an elevation equal to sea level (0m). Similar assumptions can be made in respect of large surface water bodies at inland locations.

The direction of groundwater flow in an isotropic aquifer can be drawn at right angles to the contour lines on the potentiometric surface in the direction of decreasing hydraulic head. This assumes that the aquifer is an isotropic material. In anisotropic material, for example fissured or fractured aquifers, the flow lines will be at an angle to the potentiometric contour lines.
