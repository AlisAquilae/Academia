# 7.1 Introduction
This chapter described the field methods that are applied in hydrogeological investigations. The measurement of groundwater levels and the presentation and interpretation of borehole hydrographs and groundwater level contour maps are first introduced. Next, field methods such as piezometer and pumping tests for the estimation of the aquifer properties of transmissivity and storativity are described. The application of tracer techniques in groundwater resources investigations are covered, together with an introduction to the application of geophysical methods, remote sensing techniques and numerical groundwater flow and solute transport modelling in hydrogeology

# 7.2 Measurement and Interpretation of Groundwater Level Data

The measurement and collection of groundwater level data are of fundamental importance in hydrogeology. Groundwater level data for an aquifer unit can be used for several purposes including plotting a hydrograph, determining the direction of groundwater flow by constructing a map of the potentiometric surface, and in completing a flow net. Values of hydraulic head are also essential in the process of designing and testing a numerical groundwater flow model for the purpose of making predictions of aquifer behaviour under future conditions.

## 7.2.1 Water Level Measurement
Measurement of groundwater level in the field is undertaken using either a water level dipper or by use of a submersible pressure transducer positioned just below the lowest expected groundwater level. The required field measurement is the depth from a convenient measurement datum, for example the well top or borehole flange, to the position of the groundwater level. If the elevation of the measurement datum is known from levelling techniques, then the elevation of the groundwater level (or groundwater head, $h$) can be recorded as the height above or below a local base level, typically mean sea level (MSL).

A water level dipper for use in the field comprises a length of twin-core cable, graduated in centimetres and metres, wound on to a drum and with a pair of electrodes attached to the end (Fig. 7.1). When the electrodes touch the water surface, a circuit is completed which activates either a light or a buzzer or both.

Groundwater levels are measured in either a well (Fig. 7.2a) or a purpose-built observation borehole (Fig. 7.2b). Wells are typically shallow in depth, lined with unmortared bricks and penetrate the top of the local water table in an unconfined aquifer. Observation boreholes can either be uncased (open) or cased, depending on the strength of the aquifer rock, and record the groundwater level in unconfined aquifers (for which there is a water table) or confined aquifers (for which there exists a potentiometric surface).

A special type of installation known as a piezometer (Fig. 7.2c) is designed to provide a measurement of the hydraulic head at a given depth in an aquifer. A bundle of piezometers nested in a single borehole installation can provide information on hydraulic heads at several depths in an aquifer from which the vertical component of groundwater flow, either downwards in a recharge area or upwards in a discharge zone, can be ascertained.

## 7.2.2 Well and Borehole Design and Construction Methods
Traditionally, boreholes are drilled with either an auger rig or, more usually, a percussion or rotary rig. Percussion drilling is used most often at shallow depths, while rotary methods predominate in the construction of deep boreholes and wells. 

### 7.2.2.1 Auger Drilling
Auger rigs vary from small-diameter manual augers for soil sampling to large truck- or crane-mounted augers used for drilling shafts that are more than a metre in diameter. The most common auger design is the screw auger, with a blade welded in a continuous spiral to a central solid shaft, usually supplied in 1-m sections. In continuous flight augering, drilling progresses by screwing the auger into the ground for one auger section, and then withdrawing the auger. Another section is then added to the flight and the auger lowered to the bottom of the hole.

The mechanics of the drilling are identical, but with the hollow-stem auger the spiral blade is welded to a tube. As augering progresses, a core of sediment is forced into the tube or hollow stem, to be recovered when the augers are withdrawn

Auger drilling is suitable for rapid formation sampling at shallow depths, or even for drilling small observation boreholes provided that the formation is soft and cohesive. Augering is not possible in hard rocks, dry sands or in gravels for which other methods are required. Below the water table, penetration by the auger may be impossible because of formation collapse.

### 7.2.2.2 Percussion Drilling
Compared to auger drilling, percussion drilling is suited to shale, indurated sandstone and limestone, and even to slate, basalt or granite, although progress is slow in these harder rocks. A heavy, solid-steel chisel-bit is suspended by a steel cable (cable-tool drilling) from a tripod or derrick, and dropped repeatedly. Once a certain amount of rock has been pulverized, a separate bit, known as the bailer, and comprising a length of heavy-duty steel tube with a clack-valve set into its lower end, is lowered down the borehole to remove the debris, usually with the addition of water to loosen and collect the cuttings.
