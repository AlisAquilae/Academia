# 7.1 Introduction
This chapter described the field methods that are applied in hydrogeological investigations. The measurement of groundwater levels and the presentation and interpretation of borehole hydrographs and groundwater level contour maps are first introduced. Next, field methods such as piezometer and pumping tests for the estimation of the aquifer properties of transmissivity and storativity are described. The application of tracer techniques in groundwater resources investigations are covered, together with an introduction to the application of geophysical methods, remote sensing techniques and numerical groundwater flow and solute transport modelling in hydrogeology

# 7.2 Measurement and Interpretation of Groundwater Level Data

The measurement and collection of groundwater level data are of fundamental importance in hydrogeology. Groundwater level data for an aquifer unit can be used for several purposes including plotting a hydrograph, determining the direction of groundwater flow by constructing a map of the potentiometric surface, and in completing a flow net. Values of hydraulic head are also essential in the process of designing and testing a numerical groundwater flow model for the purpose of making predictions of aquifer behaviour under future conditions.
