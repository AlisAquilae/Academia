>[!Note]
>This reader, officially titled "1. Hydrogeology", consists of multiple parts. The first part contains the relevant chapters of the book [[Hiscock & Bense (2021)-Hydrogeology-Principles and Practice|Hydrogeology-Principles and Practice]] for this course. The second part consists of information regarding hydrogeological systems. The third part contains relevant information for the practicals. I decided to split this reader into 3 given this division. The first part is contained in separate notes on the book's page (link above). The information regarding the practicals is given on the [[Hydrogeology Practicals|Practicals]] page. This note contains only the second part, namely the hydrogeological systems

# 1. Lowlands
## 1.1 Accumulation and Coastal Areas
Accumulation or coastal areas are commonly subsiding sedimentary basins where thick [[Unconsolidated Sediment]] piles have accumulated. Examples are: the Netherlands, Northern Germany and the Ganges delta in Bangladesh. The Netherlands has been a subsiding sedimentary basin for millions of years. The result is that the older formations are located at large depth.

The sedimentary basin is predominantly filled with marine deposits (clay, silt and fine sand). The coast-near deposits are characterized by a large volume of fine-grained sediments (clay and silt) and a small volume of coarse grained sediments.


| Fine grained sediments | 'Coarse' grained sediments |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Delta                  | Sea dunes                  |
| Estuaries              | Beach cysps                |
| Tidal flats            | Dunes                      |
| Lagoon                 |                            |

The coastal deposits have a high total [[Porosity]]. The [[Effective Porosity]] and [[Permeability|Conductivity]] is predominantly low as a result of the large volume of fine grained sediments. Only dunes, ‘sea dunes’ and high-water line deposits have a fairly high conductivity

In a large part of the deposits the pores are filled with salt water. That water can originate from the forming of the sedimentary rock ([[Connate Water]]) or entered this sedimentary formation later as a result of the differences in level between the sea and the polders. As a result of the rise of the sea level after the Pleistocene, the reclamation of polders and the abstraction of groundwater, the salt water enters still further into the formations (salt water intrusion).

>[!Info]
>The replacement of fresh water by salt water is a very slow process, that takes thousands to ten thousands of years. During Pleistocene vast areas of the continental shelf were dry as a result of the lowered sea level. At these places fresh water was stored in the deposits. When during Holocene the sea flooded these areas, the replacement of the fresh groundwater by salt water started. At many locations this replacement is not completed, so large quantities of fresh water can still be found under the sea floor.


In the dunes during Holocene a fresh water-lens on top of the salt water was formed. Two main causes can be given:
1. The dunes show topography: they are higher than their surroundings. It is therefore possible to generate a convexity that reaches higher than the sea level. The groundwater recharge can then be discharged as groundwater. When the dune area would not have a surface level higher than the sea level, the groundwater table would have reached surface level and therefore the precipitation excess would have been discharged via a shallow drainage pattern.
2. The dune sands have a fairly high conductivity. As a result no overland flow occurs, and groundwater recharge can take place. The dunes are an important groundwater body in lowland coastal areas as a result of this fresh water lens.

The depth of the fresh water lens (z in m) below sea level is according to the [[Ghyben-Herzberg Principle]] equal to:

$$
z = \frac{\rho_f}{\rho_s - \rho_f}hf
$$

where:
- $\rho_f$ is the fresh water density in [kg m$^{-3}$]
- $\rho_s$ is the sea water density in [kg m$^{-3}$]
- $h_f$ is the convexity

Assuming a density of the salt and fresh groundwater of respectively 1025 and 1000 kg m$^{-3}$ the thickness of the fresh water lens ($z$ in m) can be calculated as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
z &= \frac{\rho_f}{\rho_s - \rho_f}hf \\
&= \frac{1000}{1025-1000}h_f \\
&= 40h_f
\end{aligned}
$$

This shows that with a convexity of only a few meters freshwater lenses underneath coastal areas can possibly be several hundreds of meters thick. 

## 1.2 River Plains
The lowlands are located in the accumulation areas. The rocks are unconsolidated and deposited by rivers ([[Fluviatile Sediments]]). In the subsurface of almost the whole country of the Netherlands thick layers (several hundreds of meters) of these fluviatile sediments occur, on top of the Tertiary deposits. The thick layer of fluviatile sediments consists of an alteration of coarse grained aquifers and fine grained aquitards. The alteration is partly the result of the climate variations during Pleistocene. Together these aquifers and aquitards can be considered as a multi-aquifer groundwater system.

The fluviatile deposits originate from two principally different river systems, namely the meandering system and the braided river system. Both systems develop under different conditions, which has large effect on the sedimentation environment and therefore on the rocks, which are deposited in such systems.

The large volume of fine-grained sediments in a meandering river system results in a high total porosity, but a low hydraulic conductivity. Only the actual deposits in the riverbed and the point bars contain such coarse material, that groundwater flow of any importance can occur. The volume of these coarse grained sediments in terms of thickness and spatial extension is nevertheless small, compared to the total volume of the sediments. The natural levee and backswamp are too fine grained to have substantial groundwater flow.

Deposits from meandering rivers are in general not very suitable for water abstraction. Only from the river bed and point bar deposits, locally some groundwater can be abstracted. Back swamp deposits, which can be thick and extensive, can act as an aquitard for possibly underlying aquifers. In the Netherlands this situation can be found in the river-area. There the deposits from the large rivers from Holocene act as poorly permeable top layer for the underlying Pleistocene aquifer. When the hydraulic resistance of such a poorly permeable layer from a meandering river system is evaluated, the fact that such a river regularly changed its course should be taken into account. As a result some buried channels (coarse sediments) can exist between the poorly permeable fine-grained sediments (back swamp). The groundwater in the Pleistocene aquifer is, since the hydraulic resistance of the covering layer is lower, at such a location more vulnerable than at locations where over the total thickness fine-grained sediments occur.

The poorly sorted, coarse grained deposits have a relatively high total porosity and a high total conductivity. When these deposits reach a significant thickness, the [[Conductance|Transmissivity]] will be high. As a result these formations can be very suitable for groundwater abstractions. Not only water, but also pollutions can be transported relatively fast over large distances.

In areas with lowland rivers large amounts of groundwater can be abstracted. The upper limit of these abstractions is determined by the negative effects of the abstractions, like drought in nature reserves and reduced yield of agricultural crops. In areas close to the coast, like West-Utrecht, also irregular setting of the Holocene deposits and the possible lateral attraction of salt groundwater in the Pleistocene aquifer play a role.

Plains of (braided) rivers are often dissected as a result of uplift (epirogenese) and/or sea level fluctuations and climate variability, which results in the development of terraces. A terrace is thus a remain of a former valley:
