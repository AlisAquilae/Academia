# 1. Lowlands
## 1.1 Accumulation and Coastal Areas
Accumulation or coastal areas are commonly subsiding sedimentary basins where thick [[Unconsolidated Sediment]] piles have accumulated. Examples are: the Netherlands, Northern Germany and the Ganges delta in Bangladesh. The Netherlands has been a subsiding sedimentary basin for millions of years. The result is that the older formations are located at large depth.

The sedimentary basin is predominantly filled with marine deposits (clay, silt and fine sand). The coast-near deposits are characterized by a large volume of fine-grained sediments (clay and silt) and a small volume of coarse grained sediments.


| Fine grained sediments | 'Coarse' grained sediments |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Delta                  | Sea dunes                  |
| Estuaries              | Beach cysps                |
| Tidal flats            | Dunes                      |
| Lagoon                 |                            |

The coastal deposits have a high total [[Porosity]]. The [[Effective Porosity]] and [[Permeability|Conductivity]] is predominantly low as a result of the large volume of fine grained sediments. Only dunes, ‘sea dunes’ and high-water line deposits have a fairly high conductivity

In a large part of the deposits the pores are filled with salt water. That water can originate from the forming of the sedimentary rock ([[Connate Water]]) or entered this sedimentary formation later as a result of the differences in level between the sea and the polders. As a result of the rise of the sea level after the Pleistocene, the reclamation of polders and the abstraction of groundwater, the salt water enters still further into the formations (salt water intrusion).

>[!Info]
>The replacement of fresh water by salt water is a very slow process, that takes thousands to ten thousands of years. During Pleistocene vast areas of the continental shelf were dry as a result of the lowered sea level. At these places fresh water was stored in the deposits. When during Holocene the sea flooded these areas, the replacement of the fresh groundwater by salt water started. At many locations this replacement is not completed, so large quantities of fresh water can still be found under the sea floor.


In the dunes during Holocene a fresh water-lens on top of the salt water was formed. Two main causes can be given:
1. The dunes show topography: they are higher than their surroundings. It is therefore possible to generate a convexity that reaches higher than the sea level. The groundwater recharge can then be discharged as groundwater. When the dune area would not have a surface level higher than the sea level, the groundwater table would have reached surface level and therefore the precipitation excess would have been discharged via a shallow drainage pattern.
2. The dune sands have a fairly high conductivity. As a result no overland flow occurs, and groundwater recharge can take place. The dunes are an important groundwater body in lowland coastal areas as a result of this fresh water lens.

The depth of the fresh water lens (z in m) below sea level is according to the [[Ghyben-Herzberg Principle]] equal to:

$$
z = \frac{\rho_f}{\rho_s - \rho_f}hf
$$

where:
- $\rho_f$ is the fresh water density in [kg m$^{-3}$]
- $\rho_s$ is the sea water density in [kg m$^{-3}$]
- $h_f$ is the convexity

Assuming a density of the salt and fresh groundwater of respectively 1025 and 1000 kg m$^{-3}$ the thickness of the fresh water lens ($z$ in m) can be calculated as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
z &= \frac{\rho_f}{\rho_s - \rho_f}hf \\
&= \frac{1000}{1025-1000}h_f \\
&= 40h_f
\end{aligned}
$$

This shows that with a convexity of only a few meters freshwater lenses underneath coastal areas can possibly be several hundreds of meters thick. 

## 1.2 River Plains
The lowlands are located in the accumulation areas. The rocks are unconsolidated and deposited by rivers ([[Fluviatile Sediments]]). In the subsurface of almost the whole country of the Netherlands thick layers (several hundreds of meters) of these fluviatile sediments occur, on top of the Tertiary deposits. The thick layer of fluviatile sediments consists of an alteration of coarse grained aquifers and fine grained aquitards. The alteration is partly the result of the climate variations during Pleistocene. Together these aquifers and aquitards can be considered as a multi-aquifer groundwater system.

The fluviatile deposits originate from two principally different river systems, namely the meandering system and the braided river system. Both systems develop under different conditions, which has large effect on the sedimentation environment and therefore on the rocks, which are deposited in such systems.

![[Pasted image 20240907123741.png]]

The large volume of fine-grained sediments in a meandering river system results in a high total porosity, but a low hydraulic conductivity. Only the actual deposits in the riverbed and the point bars contain such coarse material, that groundwater flow of any importance can occur. The volume of these coarse grained sediments in terms of thickness and spatial extension is nevertheless small, compared to the total volume of the sediments. The natural levee and backswamp are too fine grained to have substantial groundwater flow.

Deposits from meandering rivers are in general not very suitable for water abstraction. Only from the river bed and point bar deposits, locally some groundwater can be abstracted. Back swamp deposits, which can be thick and extensive, can act as an aquitard for possibly underlying aquifers. In the Netherlands this situation can be found in the river-area. There the deposits from the large rivers from Holocene act as poorly permeable top layer for the underlying Pleistocene aquifer. When the hydraulic resistance of such a poorly permeable layer from a meandering river system is evaluated, the fact that such a river regularly changed its course should be taken into account. As a result some buried channels (coarse sediments) can exist between the poorly permeable fine-grained sediments (back swamp). The groundwater in the Pleistocene aquifer is, since the hydraulic resistance of the covering layer is lower, at such a location more vulnerable than at locations where over the total thickness fine-grained sediments occur.

The poorly sorted, coarse grained deposits have a relatively high total porosity and a high total conductivity. When these deposits reach a significant thickness, the [[Conductance|Transmissivity]] will be high. As a result these formations can be very suitable for groundwater abstractions. Not only water, but also pollutions can be transported relatively fast over large distances.

In areas with lowland rivers large amounts of groundwater can be abstracted. The upper limit of these abstractions is determined by the negative effects of the abstractions, like drought in nature reserves and reduced yield of agricultural crops. In areas close to the coast, like West-Utrecht, also irregular setting of the Holocene deposits and the possible lateral attraction of salt groundwater in the Pleistocene aquifer play a role.

Plains of (braided) rivers are often dissected as a result of uplift (epirogenese) and/or sea level fluctuations and climate variability, which results in the development of terraces. A terrace is thus a remain of a former valley:

[[Accumulation Terrace|Accumulation Terraces]] are located in the downstream part of a river. The younger terraces cover the older terraces. The younger terraces therefore are topographically higher than the older terraces. The deposits form a complex of accumulation terraces. Accumulation terraces are often very prosperous for water abstractions and are at least several meters thick. On the other hand pollutions can be transported quickly through these layers.

[[Erosion Terrace|Erosion Terraces]] are located upstream of the accumulation terraces in the middle part and especially in the upper part of the river system. The erosion of sediments is higher than the sedimentation. As a result the river cuts into its own sediments. The younger terraces then are located topographically lower than the older terraces. The thickness of the terraces can vary from several meters to one stone layer (in the upper part of the river system). During the formation of erosion terraces, two phases can be distinguished:
1. Development of a wide stream bed (width-erosion (outer boundaries) and sedimentation);
2. Dissection and fragmentation as a result of for example climate change or tectonics. 

The slope, the stream velocity and the sediment load of the river determine whether at a certain location accumulation terraces or erosion terraces are formed. 

The location where erosion terraces and accumulation terraces meet is called terrace crossing.

Well-developed erosion terraces can be found in the Netherlands along the river Meuse and in Central- and South-Limburg. In the Netherlands erosion terraces are hardly suitable for groundwater flow and groundwater abstraction, since they are mostly unsaturated and are situated on top of well permeable rock formations. In areas with hard rock such erosion terraces can be of major importance. This is depending on:
1. Thickness of the saturated layer;
2. Fragmentation of the terrace;
3. Interaction of the terrace with the river

When the terraces are more mature, it can be expected that due to erosion such terraces are more fragmented. This implies that the aquifer will be smaller in size.

Fluviatile sediment complexes, like accumulation and erosion terraces, are layered and can, because of significant variations in grain size, show preferential flow within the formation.

## 1.3 Glacially Influenced Areas

>[!Note]
>In this section only the glacially influenced lowland areas are described, because in areas at higher altitude glaciation predominantly leads to erosion. Under these conditions no sediments (possibly some glacial till) remain which can be of interest for groundwater flow and groundwater abstraction

In glacially influenced areas a number of morphological units can be found, some of which are shown in the table below


| Morphological Unit      | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glacial tongue basin    | System of aquifers and aquitards (multiple aquifer system)        |
| Ice pushed ridge        | Phreatic aquifer                                                  |
| Sandr or Sandur         | Phreatic aquifer                                                  |
| Refilled erosion gulley | Phreatic / semi-confined aquifer, sometimes aquitard or aquiclude |
| Esker                   | Phreatic aquifer                                                  |
| Kame terrace            | Phreatic aquifer                                                  |
| Ground moraine          | Usually aquitard                                                  |

### 1.3.1 Glacial Tounge Basins

>[!Example]
>E.g. Gelderse Vallei, IJssel-vallei

Glacial tounge basins were, after the retreat of the glacial body, partly filled with melting water deposits. These fluvioglacial deposits are often coarse grained. Because of the low position in the landscape often less permeable fluviatile or marine sediments occur in between these coarse fluvioglacial deposits. Also lake deposits can be poorly permeable. The stratified clays are an example of such poorly permeable layers (fine layered clays which originate from season layering; during winter less and finer sediments than during summer conditions).

The aquifers below the aquitards often show confined groundwater (sometimes artesian conditions). The aquifers in a tongue basin are very suitable for groundwater abstraction because of the high conductivity and low vulnerability to pollution because of the overlying aquitard(s).

### 1.3.2 Ice Pushed Ridges

>[!Example]
>E.g. Wageningse Berg, Utrechtse Heuvelrug, Oost Veluwe

Ice pushed ridges consist of ice pushed pre-glacial deposits. In the Netherlands such deposits predominantly consist of Pleistocene fluviatile deposits, which implies that these ridges are predominantly poorly sorted and coarse grained. The ice pushed ridges are of high hydrogeological importance as infiltration areas for the recharge of lower lying aquifers (for instance in the tongue basins and aquifers of braided river systems) on a large spatial scale. The infiltration capacity of the coarse grained soils is high, so no overland flow can be expected (under not too extreme conditions).

Result of the ice pushing are thicker layers with coarse grained material in the ice pushed ridges are good phreatic aquifers. The vulnerability of groundwater abstraction locations is nevertheless high because of the absence of covering poorly permeable layers. 

>[!Info]
>Buried ice pushed ridges (Ned: begraven stuwwallen) can be covered by poorly permeable layers (for example: the buried ice pushed ridge of the Betuwe is covered by the Holocene deposits of the meandering Meuse and Rhine system).

In the ice pushed ridges often dipping (Ned: scheefgestelde) loam layers occur, which can result in hydrologically isolated compartments. The recharge area of an abstraction location or an artificial spring (Ned. spreng) and the possible interaction between the groundwater abstraction and the spring discharge is therefore difficult to determine.

### 1.3.3 Sandrs or Sandurs

>[!Example]
>E.g. Heelumse Veld and Teutoberger Wald

Sandrs or Sandurs are outwash plains. The melting water deposits are at surface and have a small dip (Ned: geringe laaghelling). They have a limited thickness, are coarse grained (braided river system) and have a distinct layering, which is related to the temperature fluctuations during Saalian. At relative high temperatures the melting of the glacier was more profound than during the colder periods, inducing an increased transport of coarse sediments from the glacier and the ice pushed ridge to the outwash plain. The colder periods resulted in (thin) layers of finer sediment (but still sand). Sandr deposits thus clearly show hydraulic [[Anisotropy]].

The conductivity of the sandr is high, which implies that they are good phreatic aquifers, provided that they are of a sufficient thickness. On the other hand, polluting substances can be transported relatively quickly through the sandr deposits. So groundwater abstractions can be, also because of the absence of overlying poorly permeable layers, very vulnerable. In general the vulnerability of water abstractions is even a little higher than these on an ice pushed ridge because the groundwater levels in the sandr are closer to surface.

### 1.3.4 Refilled Erosion Gullies
Refilled erosion gullies originate in rock formations dissected by erosion (melting water streams), where these erosion gullies in a later stage are refilled with melting water deposits. When these gullies are cut into relatively impermeable rock material and the melting water deposits are coarse grained, they can be considered as very long-shaped, narrow aquifers. The melting water gullies in the eastern part of the Netherlands and Northern Germany, which are cut into the poorly permeable Tertiary deposits, are a good example.

The draw-down of the piezometric head of the groundwater in the channel aquifers as a result of groundwater abstraction (for instance in abstraction location Winterswijk) has, just as on the ice pushed ridge, an elliptical shape. Sometimes clay layers occur in between the sandy deposits, which induces a system of aquifers and aquitards. Groundwater abstractions in refilled erosion gullies are vulnerable when the aquitards are absent.

>[!Info]
>Sometimes the erosion gullies are filled with fine grained deposits. When these gullies exist in well permeable rock material, they form vertical barriers in the aquifer. The with heavy clay (Ned: potklei) filled erosion gullies in Noord-Nederland are an example of such gullies.


### 1.3.5 Eskers
Eskers are with meltwater deposits filled tunnels in the glacier. After the melting of the ice a long shaped ridge in the landscape remains (Fig. 3.8), which consists of poorly sorted coarse grained material. Eskers have many properties in common with the ice pushed ridges (recharge area, good aquifer, vulnerable). Welldeveloped eskers can be found in the Irish Midlands and in Canada.

### 1.3.6 Kame Terraces
Kame terraces are long-stretched elements, which can develop between the glacier and a high ridge (i.e. ice pushed ridge or hard rock). They develop when such quantities of melting water get in between the valley wall and the glacier body that streams will discharge this melting water. The rock debris and other material of the glacier and from the slopes will be transported and deposited by these streams (fluvioglacial deposits) they will form a layer of poorly sorted coarse grained deposits (braided river system), tilted parallel to the valley wall. The conductivity is thus high. When they are saturated, these terraces can act as long-stretched narrow aquifers. Especially in areas with hard rock these kame terraces can be interesting hydrogeological units for groundwater abstraction (comparable to erosion terraces). Since overlying poorly permeable layers are absent, pollutions can be transported quickly and the groundwater abstractions are therefore vulnerable to pollution.

### 1.3.7 Ground Moraine Deposits (Glacial Till)
Ground moraine deposits originate from underneath the ice cover (glacier). The deposits are very poorly sorted as a result of the absence of a sorting mechanism. Because of their poorly sorted character, combined with presence of particles smaller than 50$\mu$m, these deposits are poorly permeable. However, as overlying covering layer for underlying geological formations these ground moraine deposits are not very reliable as aquifers because:
1. the grain size distribution varies strongly and with that also the hydraulic resistance;
2. the thickness of the till layer is highly variable because of the irregular shape and because of erosion afterwards. Locally the layer can be completely removed, and
3. the fine fraction can be washed out, which leads to an increased conductivity

---
# 2. Plateau and Valley Landscapes
Plateaus are wide-stretched areas, more or less flat, clearly higher than their surroundings and at least at one side bordered by a steep slope (for instance a river valley). Often such a plateau consists of horizontally or sub-horizontally oriented geological formations.

Plateaus are commonly dissected, or bordered by deeply incised valleys, which can cause steep piezometric head gradients in the vicinity of the valleys. The volume flux density is then high, also because the groundwater abstractions are located at the borders of the valleys.

A strongly dissected plateau leads to a situation that a possible aquifer is divided in smaller isolated aquifers. As a result, larger scale groundwater abstractions are impossible. The intensity and depth of the dissection is determined by the conductivity of the upper deposit, the age, the magnitude of uplift and the erosive force of the developing streams. Also the climatic history of the area should be taken into account (i.e. glaciations). A frozen topsoil over a longer period (Pleistocene) can result in deep incisions and strong dissection.

![[Pasted image 20240907141253.png]]

Apart from aquifers with phreatic groundwater (layer 1) at plateaus, also aquifers with (semi-)confined conditions can exist (layers 2 and 3). Local, intermediate and regional groundwater systems can occur. Knowledge of the intake areas (groundwater recharge) is important for the prediction of groundwater flow and the chemical composition of water in the respective aquifers. An aquifer will only be of importance for the base flow of an adjacent river, when this aquifer is incised (for instance the small valley does not cut into layer 3)

---
# 3. Fold Mountains
Rocks in folded areas (mountainous areas) are characterized by a specific lithology and structural composition.
- **Lithology**: the rock layers are as a result of the geological history consolidated (lithified, cemented). As a result the primary porosity is low. For groundwater flow of any importance, a secondary porosity and conductivity from fractures and widening of these fractures through karst are necessary.
- **Structural framework**: the size of the aquifers in folded areas will be smaller than in non-folded areas. The aquifers are long-stretched and relatively narrow. The width of the aquifers is related to the intensity of the folding. The smaller the folds are, the smaller the size of the possible aquifers will be

Young fold mountains (Alps, Karpathian system, Andes, Himalaya) had not not sufficient time for the development of substantial secondary porosity and conductivity. When there is sufficient precipitation, there will be - because of the very strong topography and the little storage capacity of the rock material - many small springs with a low discharge volume. The springs will dry up soon after the start of a dry period. Large scale water supply in such areas is mainly from surface water reservoirs.

Old fold mountains (middle mountains, like Eifel, Ardennes, Harz, Kruˆsn´e Hory mountains) have experienced at least two phases of orogeny (Variscan orogeny during Upper-Carboniferous and the Alpine orogeny/uplift during Late Tertiary). Some of these systems are of an age that they also were influenced by a third, earlier orogeny in Upper-Silurian (Caledonian orogeny).

>[!Info]
>During the orogeny (Variscan phase) fractures are formed. After that, weathering (including chemical weathering) has led to widening of the fractures in soluble rock material, subsequently erosion induced incision, developing a drainage pattern and eventually to levelling, developing a peneplain. During or after the uplift (Alpine phase) these processes repeated (formation and eventually widening of fractures, development of a weathering cover) and by incision of the drainage pattern the peneplain is rejuvenated (dissected peneplain, formation of erosion terraces).

From these processes the following groundwater bodies can be distinguished in the old folding mountains:
- Weathered cover, when sandy
- Fractures (Ned: Diaklazen)
- Karstic limestone
- River valleys (eroison terraces)
- Refilled (glacial) erosion gullies

The sandy weathered cover and the fractures are only suitable for small scale water abstractions. The number of fractures quickly decreases to depth.

# 4. Basins
Basins, especially epicontinental basins, are subsidence areas with a diameter of 100 to 500 km in which, as a result of slow subsidence, sediment layers up to hundreds of meters have been deposited. 

>[!Example]
>Examples in Europe are the Paris basin, the London Basin and the Münster basin. The Central basin in Australia is another well-known example.

The sedimentary environment and accompanying lithology are characterized by sedimentation in a mostly shallow sea, where several types of sediment can be deposited, like sand, clay and chalk (Fig. 3.12). In general can be stated that the sands are deposited close to the coast, the clays at larger depth and therefore at larger distance to the coast and finally the chalk the furthest from the coast.

![[Pasted image 20240907142301.png]]

In contrast to the folded areas the dip of the layers is in general modest (1-2%), what results in a clearly different lithological structure. Because of the modest dip of the layers the width of the outcrops of these layers are relatively large, which has a positive effect on the groundwater recharge. As a result of the bowl-shaped structure (compare it with a soup plate) and the topographically higher elevation of the basin margins, the recharge areas of possible aquifers can be found at these basin margins.

As a result of the dip of the formations, the higher altitude of the basin margins and the alternation between permeable and less permeable layers, the piezometric head of the groundwater in the subsequent geological formations will not be the same. In the aquifers often confined groundwater and sometimes artesian water occurs.

When water is abstracted from these confined aquifers the piezometric head will drop rapidly, because of the low eslastic storage coefficient. Because of the poorly permeable layers the chemical composition in the adjacent aquifers can differ strongly. Especially in the deeper parts of the basin salt water may occur, because of the marine character of the sediments.

---
# 5. Horst- and Graben Systems
Horst- and graben areas are the result of block tectonics. Long-stretched zones are typical for such areas. Some blocks are subsided (grabens) relative to the blocks on both sides, which are lifted relative to their surroundings (horsts). The zones are bordered by a system of faults, which are oriented parallel to the length-axis of the horst and graben.

![[Pasted image 20240907142546.png]]

>[!Example]
>Well known examples are the Peelhorst and Roerdalslenk (Peel Horst and Roer Valley graben), the Rhine Valley between the Vosges and the Black Forest, the Rhône Valley, the Limagne Graben (Central France) and the Central Rift Valley (e.g. Kenia, Ethiopia).

In graben areas thick sedimentary layers can develop as a result of the accumulation of erosion products. Because of the high kD, often on a large scale good conditions for water abstraction can be found, especially since often also poorly permeable clay layers are present above the semi-confined aquifers, which are beneficial for the protection. When the horsts consist of layered sediments, the thickness of the layers (D), as a result of the dominant erosion, will be thinner than in the adjacent graben, which limits possibilities for groundwater abstraction. When the horsts consist of consolidated rocks, the possibilities for groundwater abstraction are limited to the weathered cover (regolith). Mostly no poorly permeable layers are covering these systems, which makes the abstractions vulnerable to pollution. In horst and graben systems fault zones are prominent features. 

Fault zones have an important hydrogeological role because along fault zones the permeability of the rocks can be significantly different from that away from the fault zone. However, whether permeability is reduced or enhanced strongly depends on the mechanical properties of the rocks in which the fault occurs. 

**Faults in unconsolidated rocks**: 
Hydrogeologically it is important that the systems in unconsolidated rocks can act as zones of lowered hydraulic conductivity. Lowering of the hydraulic conductivity can occur when geological formations with a higher hydraulic conductivity are at the fault bordered by layers with a lower hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, clogging of the fault surface can occur because fine grained deposits are pulled upward or downward along the fault (flexure). Groundwater that flows perpendicular to the fault then experiences hydraulic resistance, which can lead to a higher groundwater level in the fault area (occurrence of swamp areas or springs). 

>[!Info]
>Due to the alternation between dry and wet conditions (oxidation and reduction) in the fault area, the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone can even be further decreased through precipitation of chemical compounds (cementing by i.e. F e and Mn).

**Faults in consolidated rocks**
Faults in consolidated rocks, on the other hand can lead to an increased hydraulic conductivity. Due to the movement of the consolidated rock material relative to each other, in the fault area, extra and deeper fractures develop, which leads to preferential flow in such a fault region. Fault zones in limestone areas can, as a result of the larger number of fractures and the therefore increased water circulation (and dissolving), show an extra high hydraulic conductivity. 

>[!Info]
>Large, graben systems (”riftvalleys”), which can be found all over the world, are often related to deep fault systems. Along these fault zones often volcanism occurs (Limagne graben (France), Nederrijnse laagvlakte (Germany)). Related to this also many mineral springs occur, sometimes even with a thermal character. Often this water is meteoric water , which is heated and extra enriched with minerals and gasses (TDS >1000 mg l$^{−1}$ ) at large depth.


---
# 6. Alluvial Fans
In regions with large elevation differences, alluvial fans can develop, because a river will flow from a narrow valley in the higher-elevated areas into a wide plain. Such a difference in elevation can also exist in a plateau and valley landscape or in an area with horsts and grabens. 

Alluvial fans are accumulation forms which can have a very different size. They are often very extensively present in arid and semi-arid areas, but can also be found in humid regions (Costa Rica, Alps, Himalaya). The distance between the apex and the distal end can be tens of km.

![[Pasted image 20240907151308.png]]

An alluvial fan consists at the apex of poorly sorted coarse and fine material and at the distal end of fine grained deposits. Halfway between the apex and distal end, well sorted rather coarse sediments can be found. The stratification in the alluvial fan is often complex because of the large variations in discharge and sediment load of the river. As a result, the thickness and distribution of the coarse grained sandy layers can be highly variable. In the direction of the distal end, these sandy layers can end in lens shaped and wedge shaped forms. Especially in arid regions, it is likely that the coarser grained layers are inter-bedded with mudflow deposits, which form rather continuous poorly permeable layers.

The zone of maximum hydraulic conductivity in the alluvial fan is not found in the apex but, because of the better sorting of the sediments, halfway in the alluvial fan. The hydraulic conductivity of the sediments at the distal end is low. Resulting from the stratification of the alluvial fan and the associated conductivity distribution, a recharge area, a transmission zone and a discharge area can be distinguished. The aquifer at the apex is phreatic and will change into semi confined and confined conditions in the direction of the distal end. At this distal end therefore also artesian conditions can exist. 

At the distal end the quality of the deeper confined groundwater is better than that of the shallow phreatic water. The deeper groundwater comes from infiltrated river water from the mountains, whereas the phreatic water at the distal end already can get quite a high saltiness because of the high evapotranspiration in arid regions.

In areas with low amounts of precipitation, a system of wadis or oueds can develop in the alluvial fan. These dry valleys only sporadically discharge rainwater, which often comes from surrounding and upstream hills. With sufficient thickness of the sandy layers in the alluvial fan below the valleys, there is possibility for the storage of subsurface water. Often under these valleys a temporary convexity of the local groundwater level (groundwater mound) will occur (Fig. 3.20) as a result of the temporary water bearing influent river in the wadi. The natural and regular replenishment of water in the groundwater mound causes a better quality (lower TDS) than in the vicinity.

# 7. Limestone Areas
The most permeable aquifers in hard rock can be found in karstic limestone complexes. In areas where consolidated rocks can be found over an extensive area, limestone complexes are the most promising in terms of the magnitude of the groundwater resource. Spectacular large springs, disappearing surface water and precipitation and the predominant absence of surface drainage patterns are characteristic for limestone areas.

The special character of the hydrogeology of limestone areas is the result of the dissolvability of carbonate rocks in water. The widening of the fractures by dissolving the surrounding limestone and the accompanying characteristics (i.e. special topography and predominantly subsurface water flow) is called karst. The following factors are important for the development of karst:
1. Precipitation and evapotranspiration;
2. $\ce{CO2}$ production;
3. De-calcified cover layer (Ned: ontkalkte deklaag);
4. Soluble rock;
5. Fractured / joints (Ned: diaklazen);
6. No thick layer beds (Ned: geen dikke laagbanken);
7. Well-developed bedding planes (Ned: goed ontwikkelde laagvlakken);
8. Intensive groundwater flow;
9. Time

In order to have karstification there should, of course, be a precipitation excess, otherwise there will not be any downward water movement. In areas with an arid climate the karstification therefore will be limited. The CO2 production takes place in the root zone, so a vegetation cover is needed. The cover layer should be decalcified since otherwise the CO2 would be neutralized before it can reach the dissolvable rocks. Dissolvable rocks are for instance limestone, dolomite and gypsum. The structure of the limestone (presence of fractures/joints, beddings and bedding planes has a large influence on the area of contact and contact time, which is important for the rate of dissolution.

Intensive groundwater flow increases the karstification process. Under natural conditions a more intensive groundwater flow (larger flux density) occurs near the valleys slopes (Ned: dalwanden) or plateau slopes where the groundwater comes to surface and in areas with higher tectonic activity at faults and fold axes. A more intensive groundwater flow can also be created by human activity when groundwater is abstracted from the limestone aquifer. This type of karstification is called induced karst. Finally the factor time of course plays a role in the karstification process. The older the rock, the more can already be dissolved.

>[!Info]
>The depth of the karstification is mostly limited to approximately 50-75 m. At greater depth hardly any fractures occurs, so there will hardly be any groundwater flow. The amount of groundwater that can be abstracted from the limestone per unit of thickness clearly decreases to depth. At depths larger than 50-75 m hardly any groundwater can be abstracted from the limestone. Exceptions on the mentioned depths where the fracturing stops, are the areas with deep faults. In such areas, fractures up to hundreds meters of depth can occur and therefore the karstification can also develop up to much greater depth.


Two types of limestone can be distinguished: slightly cemented chalk and the dense compact (highly) consolidated limestone.

The slightly cemented chalk or friable limestone from Cretaceous or younger (<60-90 Ma) has a relatively high primary total porosity (30 tot 40%). This type of chalk (friable limestone) can be found in Southern-Limburg, SouthEngland and Normandy. It has a moderate primary conductivity, but this is related to the grain size of the chalk layer. A poorly to moderately cemented chalk, of which the grain size is equal to clay (lat. calcilutite), will have a very low conductivity. But when the grain size of the chalk is equal to the grain size of sand (lat. calcarenite), it can have reasonable conductivity.

>The karst is often limited because of the limited time elapsed since the development of the chalk layer(s). However, fracture flow can be considerable under certain conditions.


The dense, compact, highly consolidated and often older limestones (Palaeozoic, Triassic and Jurassic; >¿144 m.a.) have a primary porosity of maximally a few percent. This type of limestone can be found in for instance the Belgian Ardennes, Slovakia (low Tatra) and Slovenia (plateaus in the neighbourhood of Postonja). For these formations the magnitude of the secondary porosity and conductivity as a result of karst is important. Limestone with relatively little karstification will have a secondary conductivity of approximately 0.1–1 m day$^{−1}$ ; in highly karstified limestone (with major fractures, widened by solution) the conductivity can increase up to 750-2000 m day$^{−1}$. 

The groundwater in limestone areas is, especially with strong karstification (short residence times), very sensitive for pollution. The quality aspect is in such areas, even more so when phreatic groundwater is considered, a matter of continuous attention.

# 8. Areas with Magmatic Rocks
In areas where intrusive (=plutonic) rocks (i.e. granite) are close to or at surface (for instance the old shields of Africa and America), no groundwater flow of any importance occurs and are the possibilities for groundwater abstraction are in general limited (porosity unweathered rocks often $\lt 1\%$). The porosity and conductivity can increase as a result of the formation of fracture systems and by weathering of the rock. The thickness of the regolith (weathered cover) can vary from a few meters up to sometimes tens of meters. The number of fractures decreases to depth and is negligible below 50 – 75 m.

>Exceptions are the areas with deep faults where fractures up to considerably larger depths can be found.

Well yields from intrusive rock formations are almost always low (3 to 6 m$^3$ hr$^{−1}$). Higher yields are possible as a result of deep weathering or the presence of fractures/joints. Also in extrusive (=volcanic) rocks, from rhyolitic and andesitic volcanism, no groundwater flow of any importance occurs. The viscosity of the magma of rhyolitic and andesitic (intermediate) volcanoes is high (highly viscous magma). This results in explosive eruptions. The rocks are in general poorly sorted, distributed over a large area and they therefore form no thick layers. In these extrusive rocks, the groundwater flow and the well yields do not differ from intrusive rocks. 

In the category extrusive rocks the basalts have hydrogeologically a remarkable position. The conductivity of basalt can be equal to that of limestone. Also the chemical composition of the groundwater, in terms of dominance of calcium and bicarbonate, shows resemblance.

The factors that determine whether a complex of basalt formations is a good aquifer are:
1. Lateral extension of the flow;
2. Precipitation and evapotranspiration;
3. Well developed basalt columns and vertical contraction joints;
4. No palaeosols;
5. Age;
6. Loose interbedded layer at interface between flows;
7. Absence of tuff layers

With increasing age, the porosity and conductivity decrease as a result of compaction and cementation. Quaternary basalts can have a porosity up to 40%, where this porosity in Tertiary basalts often is reduced to <5%. A good aquifer system in a basalt
