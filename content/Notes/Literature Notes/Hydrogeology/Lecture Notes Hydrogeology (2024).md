>[!Note]
>This reader, officially titled "1. Hydrogeology", consists of multiple parts. The first part contains the relevant chapters of the book [[Hiscock & Bense (2021)-Hydrogeology-Principles and Practice|Hydrogeology-Principles and Practice]] for this course. The second part consists of information regarding hydrogeological systems. The third part contains relevant information for the practicals. I decided to split this reader into 3 given this division. The first part is contained in separate notes on the book's page (link above). The information regarding the practicals is given on the [[Hydrogeology Practicals|Practicals]] page. This note contains only the second part, namely the hydrogeological systems

# 1. Lowlands
## 1.1 Accumulation and Coastal Areas
Accumulation or coastal areas are commonly subsiding sedimentary basins where thick [[Unconsolidated Sediment]] piles have accumulated. Examples are: the Netherlands, Northern Germany and the Ganges delta in Bangladesh. The Netherlands has been a subsiding sedimentary basin for millions of years. The result is that the older formations are located at large depth.

The sedimentary basin is predominantly filled with marine deposits (clay, silt and fine sand). The coast-near deposits are characterized by a large volume of fine-grained sediments (clay and silt) and a small volume of coarse grained sediments.


| Fine grained sediments | 'Coarse' grained sediments |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Delta                  | Sea dunes                  |
| Estuaries              | Beach cysps                |
| Tidal flats            | Dunes                      |
| Lagoon                 |                            |

The coastal deposits have a high total [[Porosity]]. The [[Effective Porosity]] and [[Permeability|Conductivity]] is predominantly low as a result of the large volume of fine grained sediments. Only dunes, ‘sea dunes’ and high-water line deposits have a fairly high conductivity

In a large part of the deposits the pores are filled with salt water. That water can originate from the forming of the sedimentary rock ([[Connate Water]]) or entered this sedimentary formation later as a result of the differences in level between the sea and the polders. As a result of the rise of the sea level after the Pleistocene, the reclamation of polders and the abstraction of groundwater, the salt water enters still further into the formations (salt water intrusion).

>[!Info]
>The replacement of fresh water by salt water is a very slow process, that takes thousands to ten thousands of years. During Pleistocene vast areas of the continental shelf were dry as a result of the lowered sea level. At these places fresh water was stored in the deposits. When during Holocene the sea flooded these areas, the replacement of the fresh groundwater by salt water started. At many locations this replacement is not completed, so large quantities of fresh water can still be found under the sea floor.


In the dunes during Holocene a fresh water-lens on top of the salt water was formed. Two main causes can be given:
1. The dunes show topography: they are higher than their surroundings. It is therefore possible to generate a convexity that reaches higher than the sea level. The groundwater recharge can then be discharged as groundwater. When the dune area would not have a surface level higher than the sea level, the groundwater table would have reached surface level and therefore the precipitation excess would have been discharged via a shallow drainage pattern.
2. The dune sands have a fairly high conductivity. As a result no overland flow occurs, and groundwater recharge can take place. The dunes are an important groundwater body in lowland coastal areas as a result of this fresh water lens.
