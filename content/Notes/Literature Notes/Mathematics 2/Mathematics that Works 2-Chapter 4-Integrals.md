### 4.1 Derivative and Antiderivative
The **derivative** of the function $f(x)=x^3$ is found by [[Differentiation]] of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. The result is $f'(x)=3x^2$. If reversely a function $f(x)$ is sought for which $f'(x)=3x^2$, then $f(x)=x^3$ is the solution

The reverse process of differentiation is [[Antidifferentiation]]. In antidifferentiating a function $g(x)$, we look for a function $f(x)$ such that $f'(x)=g(x)$. The function $f(x)$ is called an **antidervative** of $g(x)$. 

The requested function in antidifferentiation is not uniquely defined. We can always add a constant to a given solution, to produce a different function with the same derivative; this constant disappears in differentiation. Therefore, the antiderivative of a function is defined up to a constant

>[!Example]
>All the antiderivatives of $f(x)=2x+1$ can be written as $F(x)=x^2+x+C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant

The antiderivative is denoted using $F(x)$ (with a capital $F$)

#### 4.1.1 Antidifferentiation
The search for an antiderivative is called antidifferentiation or **integration**. In this context, we speak of the **integral** of $f(x)$, indicated by the integral sign

$$
\int f(x)dx=F(x)+C
$$

Where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $x$

The integral is defined except for an additive constant; hence, we use the term **indefinite integral**. The constant $C$ is called the constant of integration. The function $f(x)$ behind the integral sign is called the **integrand**: this is the function for which we need the antiderivative. Behind that function is the symbol dx, indicating that x is the variable with respect to which we integrate. In this context, this variable $x$ is called the **variable of integration**

#### 4.1.2 Direct Integration
Just as we know standard derivatives, so do we know standard antiderivatives


| Function   | Antiderivative      |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| $f(x)=x^a$ | $F(x)=\frac{1}(a+1) |
