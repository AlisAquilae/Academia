### 4.1 Derivative and Antiderivative
The **derivative** of the function $f(x)=x^3$ is found by [[Differentiation]] of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. The result is $f'(x)=3x^2$. If reversely a function $f(x)$ is sought for which $f'(x)=3x^2$, then $f(x)=x^3$ is the solution

The reverse process of differentiation is [[Antidifferentiation]]. In antidifferentiating a function $g(x)$, we look for a function $f(x)$ such that $f'(x)=g(x)$. The function $f(x)$ is called an **antidervative** of $g(x)$. 

The requested function in antidifferentiation is not uniquely defined. We can always add a constant to a given solution, to produce a different function with the same derivative; this constant dissapears in differentiation. Therefore, the antider
