### 1.1 Introduction
The relation between two quantities is often expressed as a **function**. To refresh your knowledge of the standard functions, in the first two parts of this chapter we review the most frequently used standard functions, and we state their most important properties. 

If a function itself expresses the dependency of one quantity upon another, the derivative of that function gives the rate of change of the first quantity with respect to the second one.

The third part of this chapter presents a recapitulation of differentiation and gives the derivatives of the standard functions

### 1.2 The Standard Functions
#### 1.2.1 Functions as a Model
A mathematical model is a mathematical description (by means of functions or equations) of an observable phenomenon, The goal of modelling is to gain insight in the phenomenon and to allow for predictions about its behaviour, which is the quintessence of science.

A model can never give a complete representation of reality; it is always a simplification. A good model tries to find a balance between simplicity and accuracy; it must be simple enough to enable calculations and relevant conclusions, and it should be accurate enough to make these conclusions reliable. If a simple model gives a description of the observations that is equally as good as that of a more complicated model, the simple model is to be preferred. 

#### 1.2.2 Linear Functions
A function $f$(x) can be depicted in a graph by drawing points (x, $f$(x)) in the (x, y)-plane. The result is a curve in the (x, y)-plane with equation $y=f$(x).

The simplest type of functions are the [[Linear Functions]]: 

$$
y=f(\text{x})=a \text{x}+b
$$

The graph of a linear function is a straight line.

A special case arises where $b=0$. In this case, the graph is a traight line through the origin (0, 0). Another special case arises when $a=0$. Then, $f$(x) does not depend on x at all; we call it a **constant function**. The graph of a constant function is the horizontal straight line $y=b$. 

>[!Note]
>If $a=0$ and $b=0$, this line coincides with the x-axis

The numbers $a$ and $b$ are **parameters**: they determine the behaviour of the function. 
- The point of intersection with the y-axis (at $\text{x}=0$) is located at $y=b$, so $b$ is the **vertical intercept**
- $a$ is called the **slope** of the line. The larger $a$ the steeper the line; when we add 1 unit to x, then $y$ increases by $a$ units. If $a$ is negative, then the line is decreasing

>If the graph of $y$ as a function of $\text{x}$ is a straight line, the graph of $\text{x}$ as a function of $y$ is a straight line too. 

#### Powers and Functions
In many applications, the relation between 2 quantities is modelled with a linear function, often merely because there is no better information available. If such information is present, however, relations that are more complex can be taken into consideration. In this section, we present functions that can model such a more complex relation

A first group of functions are the [[Power Functions]]: 

$$
f(\text{x})=c\text{x}^p
$$

in which $c$ and $p$ are the parameters. These functions can model very different types of behaviour. If $c$ and $p$ are positive, $f(\text{x})$ is increasing and $f(0)=0$. If $c$ is positive and $p$ is negative, $f(\text{x})$ is decreasing for $\text{x} \gt 0$ and $f(\text{x})$ is decreasing for $\text{x} \lt 0$.

>**Roots** are powers too. For example $\sqrt{\text{x}}=
