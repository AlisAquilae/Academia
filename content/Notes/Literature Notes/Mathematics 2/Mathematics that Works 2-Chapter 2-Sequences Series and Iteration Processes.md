### 2.1 Sequences and Series
In many areas of science, [[Sequences]] of numbers are used. The individual numbers in the sequence are called **terms**; the first term is denoted by $t_1$, the second by $t_2$, and the nth by $t_n$. An (infinite) sequence thus consists of the terms: 

$$
t_1, t_2, t_3, \dots, t_n, \dots
$$

Where the $\dots$ at the end indicate that the sequence is infinite

It is impossible to infer unambiguously from the first few terms of a sequence what the following terms will be. But if we think that we recognise a pattern, we can try to make a prediction.

>The sequence $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots$ is found. We may suppose that the nth term will be $t_n=n^2$

A sequence that has many applications is the [[Geometric Sequence]]. It has the form 

$$
t_1=a, t_2=ar, t_3=ar^2, t_3=ar^3, \dots
$$

The nth term is given by $t_n=ar^{n-1}$. Each new term of a geometric sequence arises by multiplying its predecessor by a (constant) factor $r$, so 

$$
t_n=rt_{n-1}
$$

The factor $r$ is called the **common ratio** of the geometric sequence

Worded differently, a sequence is a geometric sequence if the quotient of two consecutive terms is constant:

$$
t_n / t_{n-1}=r
$$

>[!Example]
>If the terms $1, \frac12, \frac14, \frac18, \frac{1}{16}, \dots$ form the beginning of a geometric sequence, then $a=1$ and $r=\frac12$. The nth term is then given by $t_n=\left(\frac12 \right)^{n-1}$
