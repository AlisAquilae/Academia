### 3.1 Derivative and Change
#### 3.1.1 The Tangent Line and the First Order Approximation
Imagine a non-linear function together with its tangent line at $x=a$. The formula for a tangent line is 

$$
y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)
$$

The tangent line itself ia the graph of a function $g(x)$,

$$
g(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)
$$

At $x=a$, this function has the same value as $f(x)$, so $g(a)=f(a)$. Furthermore, they have the same derivatives at $x=a$, so $g'(a)=f'(a)$. 

We call $g(x)$ the **First Order Approximation** (linear approximation) of $f(x)$ about $x=a$, and it gives a fair approximation for $f(x)$ close enough to $x=a$. The replacement of $f(x)$ by its first order approximation is called **linearization**
