# Introduction
Models on monday and tuesday depend on time. This is a single variable, usually $t$. Thus, also differential equations of variables with 1 variable

Here, they still depend on time but also on other variable, such as place. 

Thus, we deal with Partial differential equations. 

# Chain Rule
We will extend the chain rule to functions having a more complex structure than $f(x(t))$. To help us understand how this works, we will use the theory of linear approximations for small deviations. 

## Linear Approximation 2d (tangent line)
In the neighbourhood fo aposition x=a, a function f(x) can be approximated by its tangent line (linear approximation), with standard formula: $y(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$

In the neighbourhood of these functions, the tangent line is close to the function

If 2-a is small, the tangent line y(x) approximates the original function f(x)

$f(x) \cong f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$

Writing Delta x for the small displacement x-a can be done by redcucing the funcrtion by f(a) on both sides. This gives us

$$
\Delta f \cong f'(a)\Delta x
$$

This tells us that for a small d
