Time dependent systems are systems which evolve in time. These can be researched using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

General steps for working with ODEs
- Observe the real world
- Set up a mathematical model which simplifies this world, makes certain assumptions, etc.
- Gain information from the model by finding exact solutions, approximating the solutions, or studying the properties of the solutions (i.e. qualitative solutions)
- Interpret results and draw conclusions about the real world.
