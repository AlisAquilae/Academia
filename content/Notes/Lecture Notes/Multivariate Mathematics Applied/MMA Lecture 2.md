TDS covers ordinary differential equations

Extremely useful in modelling systems which continually evolve in time (instead of iterating processes)

What is a differential equation? It is an equation. An equality involving an unknown function and its derivative(s)

Example:

$$
tx'(t) - x(t) = 2t^3
$$

A solution is a choice of the unknown function for which the equation is satisfied (for all values of t)

## Concepts in differential equations
Ordinary differential equations (ODE): Only one independent variable involved, usually $t$ (so we have $x(t)$ but not $x(t, x)$)

First order differential equation. First order derivative as highest order derivative involved. We are mostly going to see these

Time-invariant first order differential equations: of the form $x'(t)
So
