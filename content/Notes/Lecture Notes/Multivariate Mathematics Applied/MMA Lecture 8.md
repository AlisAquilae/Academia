# Intro
Diffusion: $c_t(x,t) = Dc_{xx}(x,t)$
Convection: $c_t(x,t)=-vc_x(x,t)$

# Convection and Diffusion
Convection means that particles move towards a direction.

Diffusion means that the particles move in a random direction. 

Today, the only spatial direction we consider is X, that is, one horizontal direction.
