# Groundwater Investigation Techniques
There are techniques you can employ from the surface. 

Hydrogeophysical techniques

Resistivity is the capacity of a soil to transmit electrical currents, or the extent to which it hinders it. 

Scales
- Pore scale: 10-6 - 10-2 m: (pore physics)
- Core scale: 10-1 - 10-0 m (describing flow equations, such as hydraulic conductivity at a certain temperature and a certain fresh water status)
- Local scale: 10-2 - 10-3 m (three dimensional groundwater flow, local groundwater problems)
- Regional scale: 10-3 - 10-5 m (permeable layers and less permeable layers)

The larger the scale, the larger the reliance on geophysical methods. 

Local scale:
- Piezometer tests (slug test = quick addition of water, bail test = quick removal of water, see time of recovery)

Fractured rock setting:
- Single, open borehole (simply a hole drilled). Can intersect various fracture zones that can be hydraulically short-circuited via the borehole (flow from one fracture to another). As a result fluid flow in borehole can occur and be variable with depth. Various techniques are available to measure in-well fluid flow. Borehole impeller logging. Temperature techniques using Distributed Temperature Sensing (geophysical, measurement of temperature along a fibre-optic cable using light; temperature distribution os obtained by 'time of flight' of light to and from parts of the cable)
- Double, open borehole: input warm water, measure temperature in other borehole.

# Aquifer testing
Extract water, and study the influence of this on the groundwater (specifically the depth of the depression and resulting shape of the groundwater table) using nearby piezometers.

# Hydrogeophysical Methods
Geophysical methods aim to establish subsurface physical properties through measurements taken at the surface, from the sky, or within boreholes, to look at the invisible

Examples include seismic refraction, seismic reflection, electrical resistivity
Electromagnetic resistivity, ground-penetrating radar

Electrical resistivity very good to differentiate between sedimentary soils, as well as to detect saline water (e.g. salt intrusion)
