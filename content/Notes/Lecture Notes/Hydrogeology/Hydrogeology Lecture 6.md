# Groundwater Investigation Techniques
There are techniques you can employ from the surface. 

Hydrogeophysical techniques

Resistivity is the capacity of a soil to transmit electrical currents, or the extent to which it hinders it. 

Scales
- Pore scale: 10-6 - 10-2 m: (pore physics)
- Core scale: 10-1 - 10-0 m (describing flow equations, such as hydraulic conductivity at a certain temperature and a certain fresh water status)
- Local scale: 10-2 - 10-3 m (three dimensional groundwater flow, local groundwater problems)
- Regional scale: 10-3 - 10-5 m (permeable layers and less permeable layers)

The larger the scale, the larger the reliance on geophysical methods.
