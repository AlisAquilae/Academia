# Top Systems
Dirchlet: no flow in or out of your system

Top systems are interaction of grounwdater system with the hydrological phenomeno on top (around surface level, i.e. maaiveld). In this practical only: interaction between groundwater and open water. Think of lakes and rivers. 

Lakes and rivers contain sediment at the bottom, whichi has a different conductivity from the rest of the soil around the lake, 

Flux exchange between groundwater and open water (ON TOP OF AQUIFER)
Darcy = q = delta H over C

Qn + Qe + Qs + Qw + Qext + Qtop = 0

Qtop = Area (or length) = (Htop - Hc) / C
