# Introduction
Porosity goes down with the age of the rock

The lower the (effective) porosity, generally the lower the conductivity

We call a system a hydrogeological system if there is sufficient groundwater flow.

# Accumulation- and Coastal Areas
Netherlands 2 areas:
- Holocene accumulation $\lt 10000$ y
- Pleistocene accumulation $\gt 10000$ y

Dunes consist of sand, which generally has good porosity and good hydraulic conductivity. Thus we would not expect surface water. However, we do see this. This is unexpected, because we would expect the groundwater to flow away given the convexity of the groundwater table. However, they started fresh water extraction there. This causes the water to move towards this area. 

In addition, we see a fresh water bell below the dunes. This is because salt water is heavier than fresh water. 

The fresh water bell is quite large, due to the Ghyben-Herzberg Principle.

They started overextracting water. Thus they used artificial recharge

# River Plains
River plains in lowland areas: braided rivers. In braided rivers, we see different routes being taken by the water due to sedimentation. This creates the braided pattern. This creates a lot of erosion and sedimentation. 

Typical for braided rivers: very coarse materials, poorly sorted, very complex geological formations (heterogeneous), which impacts groundwater flow by causing local differences in the speed of flow. Strongly fluctuating flow rate and velocity

As for meandering systems. Relatively fine sediments. Flow velocity is lower, capacity of sediment transport is less. Smaller hydraulic gradient. Large volume of fine-grained sediments

Meandering rivers: large total porosity, low effective porosity (due to clayey materials), low saturated conductivity

We can get different terraces near the rivers. Erosion terraces. Typical is for thoe whole system land comes up or goes down due to tectonics. The river erodes as well as deposits sediment. This creates a step-wise system. Oldest soils are highest in the system, lowest soils in lower parts of the system. Oldest soils are almost consolidated. Higher in the system is often less saturated. Thickness of saturated layer is important, fragmentation of the terrace is important (older means more weathering and erosion) and the interaction of the terrace with the river

# Glacially influenced areas
Sandr or Sandur means outwash plain

Ground moraine is called bolderclay.

# Plateau and Valley landscapes
We see plateaus in which rivers have cut into, creating river valleys.
