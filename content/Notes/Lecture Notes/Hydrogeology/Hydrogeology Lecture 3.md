# Introduction
Porosity goes down with the age of the rock

The lower the (effective) porosity, generally the lower the conductivity

We call a system a hydrogeological system if there is sufficient groundwater flow.

# Accumulation- and Coastal Areas
Netherlands 2 areas:
- Holocene accumulation $\lt 10000$ y
- Pleistocene accumulation $\gt 10000$ y

Dunes consist of sand, which generally has good porosity and good hydraulic conductivity. Thus we would not expect surface water. However, we do see this. This is unexpected, because we would expect the groundwater to flow away given the convexity of the groundwater table. However, they started fresh water extraction there. This causes the water to move towards this area. 

In addition, we see a fresh water bell below the dunes. This is because salt water is heavier than fresh water.
