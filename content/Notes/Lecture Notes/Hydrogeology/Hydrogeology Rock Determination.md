# Rock Cycle
It is called sediment when it has transported. If it is just weathered but not moved, it is called rigolith

Magma becomes igneous rock, magmatic rock, volcanic rock, when it cools down. If this is weathered or eroded, it becomes rigolith. These can be transformed into sedimentary rocks through lithification. When it becomes hotter, the sedimentary rock becomes a metamorphic rock. There are different grades of metamorphic rock, depending on the temperature. 

Igneous rock does not turn into magma directly when heated, but first becomes metamorphic rock. Similarly, metamorphic rock when cooled does not become a sedimentary rock, but rather a sediment. 

# Silica structures: Olivine group
Silica is created rfom 4 oxygen and 1 silica. 4 oxygen is -8 charge, and silica is +4. So we have a -4 charge of the rock. The earth compensates for this by including iron, manganese, magnesium, etc. The color of the rock depends on the secondary element added. The group is called the olivine group

SIO4

# Silica Structures: Pyroxene group
A silica that has 3 oxygen and shares an oxygen with another element, as well as 1 silica, is called a pyroxene group. The oxygens are in a straight line

vanderwaal's bindings: weak connections between the additional elements

SIO3

# Silica Structures; Phyllosilicates
Examples: mica, clay
Same as above, but now the oxygens are aligned in 2d

# Tectosilicates group
All directions strong chemical bindings with all shared elements. Neutral charge, so no metals needed to compensate. 

SIO2

# Igneous rocks
All these silicates are created from lava

Intrusive means solidified inside the earth. Extrusive means solidified outside the earth. Intrusive means slow cooldown. It has the time to create nice metals. Extrusive has contact with atmosphere, and therefore cools down much faster. Does not have time to create minerals. 

Intrusive rocks: coarse minerals. Extrusive rocks: fine mineralss

More SIO4 means flowing magma, because it is more viscous due to the weak vanderwaal's bindings. 

More SIO2 means exploding volcanoes, because it is much less viscous. Pressure builds up due to the rock formation, cool down and getting stuck.
