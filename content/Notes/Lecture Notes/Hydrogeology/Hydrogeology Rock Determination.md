# Rock Cycle
It is called sediment when it has transported. If it is just weathered but not moved, it is called rigolith

Magma becomes igneous rock, magmatic rock, volcanic rock, when it cools down. If this is weathered or eroded, it becomes rigolith. These can be transformed into sedimentary rocks through lithification (solidification). When it becomes hotter, the sedimentary rock becomes a metamorphic rock. There are different grades of metamorphic rock, depending on the temperature. 

Igneous rock does not turn into magma directly when heated, but first becomes metamorphic rock. Similarly, metamorphic rock when cooled does not become a sedimentary rock, but rather a sediment. 

# Silica structures: Olivine group
Silica is created rfom 4 oxygen and 1 silica. 4 oxygen is -8 charge, and silica is +4. So we have a -4 charge of the rock. The earth compensates for this by including iron, manganese, magnesium, etc. The color of the rock depends on the secondary element added. The group is called the olivine group

SIO4

# Silica Structures: Pyroxene group
A silica that has 3 oxygen and shares an oxygen with another element, as well as 1 silica, is called a pyroxene group. The oxygens are in a straight line

vanderwaal's bindings: weak connections between the additional elements

SIO3

# Silica Structures; Phyllosilicates
Examples: mica, clay
Same as above, but now the oxygens are aligned in 2d

# Tectosilicates group
All directions strong chemical bindings with all shared elements. Neutral charge, so no metals needed to compensate. 

SIO2

# Igneous rocks
All these silicates are created from lava

Intrusive means solidified inside the earth. Extrusive means solidified outside the earth. Intrusive means slow cooldown. It has the time to create nice metals. Extrusive has contact with atmosphere, and therefore cools down much faster. Does not have time to create minerals. 

Intrusive rocks: coarse minerals. Extrusive rocks: fine minerals

More SIO4 means flowing magma, because it is more viscous due to the weak vanderwaal's bindings. 

More SIO2 means exploding volcanoes, because it is much less viscous. Pressure builds up due to the rock formation, cool down and getting stuck. 

Granite: lot of visible minerals. More SIO2
More SIO4 dominated: basalt. Black because negative charge, requiring you to have metals. These metals colour the rock

Granite found a lot inside the earth, because it is solidified inside. Rhyolite, the extrusive variant, found little. Basalt, solidified outside, and very viscous. Thus found a lot. Periodite is intrusive equivalent, and given that it is fluid, it is found less. 

SIO4 weathers a lot because of the weaker bindings, SO2 for that reason weathers a lot less. 

Basalt has a much higher density than granite, meaning that when oceanic and continental tectonic plates collide, the oceanic plates which contain mostly basalt tend to dive underneath the continental plates.

Felsic volcano is explosive, mavic volcano is flowing volcano

# Water flow
Basalt: primary porosity is not present. Secondary porosity on the intersections of the polygons. This can form a pretty good aquifer. Some variants of basalt which contain CO2 that is released, you get a basalt rock with a large amount of voids. If these voids are connected, we have large primary porosity

# Unconcolidated sedimentary rocks: grain sizes
Clay: $\lt 2 \mu m$ (porosity highest, lower conductivity because too small pores. HC .001 m/d)
Silt: $2 - 50 \mu m$ (powdery, hardly visible grain sizes, primary porosity and primary hydraulic conductivity. HC .01 m/d)
Gravel: $2 - 50 mm$ (quite coarse. HC 100 m/d)
Sand: $50 \mu m - 2 mm$ (bit coarser. HC 1 m/d)

# Weathering, erosion transport and deposition 1: From granite to sand
Forcing:
- Weathering: mechanical and chemical force
- Erosion: weathering conditions


Monocyclic sand: Lot of dark minerals due to there being minerals in the original rock. Colorful sand. One cycle of weathering and deposition
Polyciclyc sand: Second cycle of weathering. All colors gone, mostly consists of silica. 

This also influences the dissolved minerals in your water. Monocuclic sand: more minerals, more weathered dissolved minerals, higher electric conductivity

## From sand to sandstone
Forcing:
- Burial: new sediments over old sediments
- Lithification: increased pressure and relatively low temperature
- Time

Unconcolidated sand: polyciclic sand => 
consolidated sediment: sandstone. Can have HC, but lower porosity and therefore lower flow => highly consolidated sediment => sandstone. Even less porosity, barely any flow

Melt: from quartzite to magma

# Burial and Lithification 2: From Silt to Siltstone
Forcing: 


Unconcolidated sediment:  Silt
Siltstone

Quartzite

When you have silica dominated material, all of it turns into quartzite under heat

# From Clay to Shale
Still has clay fragments, but becomes even more platey

# Shale to Phyllite
Phyllite to slate. Only with little minerals

# Shale to Schist
After metamorphism: Schist. Only happens with colorful / mineral shale

# Granite to Gneiss
Igneous rock of granite to metamorphic rock of Gneiss. Looks almost the same. Gneiss, however, contains layering of minerals. Porosity and conductivity non-existent, with the exception of some weathered cover. 

# From fragmented chalk fragments to limestone
