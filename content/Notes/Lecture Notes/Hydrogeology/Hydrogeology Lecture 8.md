# Permafrost Hydrogeology
Permafrost hydrogeology dit not use to exist as a field

We cannot say there is a seal on groundwater through permafrost, as we do in fact see some interaction through the holes in the permafrost. 

Permafrost means that average annual soil temperature is below zero degrees celcius for at least two consecutive years

Continuous permafrost: permafrost is everywhere spatially
Discontinuous: mostly connected permafrost, but also some gaps
Isolated: some isolated patches of permafrost

In other words, geographical distribution

At top of ice sheet, very cold temperatures. Deeper in the earth, temperature of permafrost increases. At the base of the ice sheet, we find the shift from 0 degrees to positive temperatures
