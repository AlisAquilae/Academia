# Horst and Graben Systems
Uplifted part is a Horst, sinking part is a graben. We see a stretch or push of two plates due to tectonics. This causes the middle part to either sink (making it a graben) or rise (making it a horst). The faults are almost never straight. 

We often see that when the land sinks in it tends to collect new sediments. Thus, we see horsts being mostly erosive, containing old sediments, and the grabens containing newer sediments due to sedimentation. 

For groundwater movement, the Horst is old and therefore not very conductive. The Graben contains younger sediments, and therefore probably do have porosity and hydraulic conductivity. 

You often see layers with different conductivity next to each other (e.g. high next to low), reducing the flow. Moreover, you often see fine grained material which is more flexible. This is 'smeared' across the faults, resisting the water flow. Finally, we see iron and manganese in these rocks, which through oxidation form a film on the fault, limiting water flow.

This is all for unconsolidated H&G

For consolidated, we see breaks forming due to the faults. This increases fractures, increases weathering and, in the case of limestone, increases karstification. This increases conductivity relatively.

# Alluvial Fans
Rivers from mountains, which bring eroded material with them and sediment them outside of the mountains where the flow velocity is lower. We see a layered system which comes to be due to sometimes there being more snow than other times, meaning that sometimes the amount of deposited sand is larger than other times. So it gradually goes from a good aquifer to an aquitard to an aquiclude.

We often see seepage due to the groundwater not being able to continue any further. 

Alluvial fans are often good sources of drinking water

# Limestone Areas
Chalk for poorly consolidated, limestone for highly consolidated. Chalk is therefore relatively young and limestone relatively old. 

For karstification, we need
- A rain surplus
- CO2 (produced by plants in the root zone)
- De-calcified cover layer (otherwise the chemical reaction occurs in this top layer)
- Soluble rock (obviously)
- Fracures / joints (to move the water)
- Thin layer beds (the clay between bedding palnes. we want these to be thin to facilitate flow)
- Well developed bedding planes (nice gaps between and in the bedding planes)
- Intensive groundwater flow
- Time

Karstification definition: the process where carbonate outcrops to the earth's surface is exposed to leeching and dissolution by atmospheric water.
