# Horst and Graben Systems
Uplifted part is a Horst, sinking part is a graben. We see a stretch or push of two plates due to tectonics. This causes the middle part to either sink (making it a graben) or rise (making it a horst). The faults are almost never straight. 

We often see that when the land sinks in it tends to collect new sediments. Thus, we see horsts being mostly erosive, containing old sediments, and the grabens containing newer sediments due to sedimentation. 

For groundwater movement, the Horst is old and therefore not very conductive. The Graben contains younger sediments, and therefore probably do have porosity and hydraulic conductivity.
