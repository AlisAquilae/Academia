# Porisity
Groundwater is found in voids in soils, such as pores, cracks and dissolution conduits. This is called porosity

Porosity determines how much water a certain rock / soil can hold

An important first indication of whether a certain rock unit might form an aquifer or not

We measure porosity by measuring the amount of water needed to fully saturate it. 

Porosity is the ratio of the volume of voids Vv and total volume Vt

There are 2 types of porosity
- Primary porosity is developed at the time when the rock was formed. This is usually large in unconsolidated (non-cemented) rocks (e.g. sediments, sand, clay). Very small in consolidated (cemented) rocks (like granite, basalt, shale, quartzite). If the consolidation increases even more, the porosity decreases. Only to a few percent. This occurs because of burial (new sediment over old, increasing pressure) and lithification (incerased pressure and temperature and time)
- Secondary porosity is void spaces such as fractures which develop due to movement of the earth crust. These fractures can be widened even further by the dissolving processes (called karstic conduits). The volume of fractures and cavities is called secondary porosity. Crystalline rock such as igneous and metamorphic rocks have hardly any primary porosity

Sometimes the primary porosity is called matrix porosity and secondary porosity is sometimes called fracture porosity

In unconsolidated rocks, the primary porosity is defined by
- The size of the grains or rock fragments: same packing but smaller grain size does not affect total porosity
- Sorting of the grains or rock fragments. Well sorted material is high and low grain sizes separated, having higher porosity than when high and low grain size are mixed (which is called poorly sorted material)
- Arrangement / piling / packing (spatial): More efficient packing leads to a lower porosity for the same grain size
- Shape

In consolidated material rocks the primary porosity is determined by
- The 4 factors above
- The compaction
- The cementation

In a rock layer, in principle, there is a possibility of both primary and secondary porosity being present. This is called dual porosity. Usually, in unconsolidated rocks, the total porosity is only due to primary porosity; secondary porosity is almost never present. In consolidated rocks primary as well as secondary porosity can occur.

The secondary porosity is generally low compared to primary porosity, but the influence on the water flow is large. 

Effective porosity implies that not all pore spaces in a rock layer to actually contribute to groundwater flow. Some pores are not connected to other pores. The effective porosity $n_e$ is equal to the volume of connected voids $V_{cv}$ to the total volume $V_t$. 

In unconsolidated sedimentary rocks, the smaller the grain size, the higher the total porosity, but the lower the effective porosity. This is because of the chemical bonding between clay and water

Specific yield, or drainage porosity, is the ratio or percentage of the total volume which can be drained by gravity. This is a property of the unconfined aquifer. For confined aquifer, the equivalent is called specific storage. We will first discuss specific yield

Sepcific yield is the volume of water drained by gravity divided by the total volume.

The part of water that remains in the soil after draining all water with gravity, is called the specific retention. If effective porosity is equal to total porosity, the same sum of specific yield and specific retention also gives the effective porosity.
