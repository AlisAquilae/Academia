# Porisity
Groundwater is found in voids in soils, such as pores, cracks and dissolution conduits. This is called porosity

Porosity determines how much water a certain rock / soil can hold

An important first indication of whether a certain rock unit might form an aquifer or not

We measure porosity by measuring the amount of water needed to fully saturate it. 

Porosity is the ratio of the volume of voids Vv and total volume Vt

There are 2 types of porosity
- Primary porosity is developed at the time when the rock was formed. This is usually large in unconsolidated (non-cemented) rocks (e.g. sediments, sand, clay). Very small in consolidated (cemented) rocks (like granite, basalt, shale, quartzite). If the consolidation increases even more, the porosity decreases. Only to a few percent. This occurs because of burial (new sediment over old, increasing pressure) and lithification (incerased pressure and temperature and time)
- Secondary porosity is void spaces such as fractures which develop due to movement of the earth crust. These fractures can be widened even further by the dissolving processes (called karstic conduits). The volume of fractures and cavities is called secondary porosity. Crystalline rock such as igneous and metamorphic rocks have hardly any primary porosity

Sometimes the primary porosity is called matrix porosity and secondary porosity is sometimes called fracture porosity
