# Porisity
Groundwater is found in spaces in soils, such as pores, cracks and dissolution conduits. This is called porpsoty

Porosity determines how much water a certain rock / soil can hold

An important first indication of whether a certain rock unit might form an aquifer or not

We measure porosity by measuring the amount of water needed to fully saturate it. 

Porosity is the ratio of the volume of voids
