# Answers Rock Practical
Does granite when weathered cause a rise in dissolved solids? Yes, dark coloured parts relatively easy to weather. Thus rise

Weathering of diorite: what do you expect in the groundwater? Calcium and Natrium. Total dissolved solids relatively low

Weathering of Gabbro vs Basalt: minerals of basalt smaller. Relatively large contact volume in basalt. But water needs access to contact surface. 

Rhyolite vs Granite: rhyolite smaller minerals. Fine mineral has relatively more contact surface, so will weather faster. Only when granite is fractured it will have more interaction and weathering. 

Andesite vs Rhyolite groundwater. Both extrusive rocks. Similar contact surface. Andsite has a larger share of dark easy weatherable minerals. the TDS will be higher in an andesite

Basalt CO2 bubbles: Causes increased porosity. Effective porosity depends on weather these holes caused by CO2 are connected.
