# Answers Rock Practical
Does granite when weathered cause a rise in dissolved solids? Yes, dark coloured parts relatively easy to weather. Thus rise

Weathering of diorite: what do you expect in the groundwater? Calcium and Natrium. Total dissolved solids relatively low

Weathering of Gabbro vs Basalt: minerals of basalt smaller. Relatively large contact volume in basalt. But water needs access to contact surface. 

Rhyolite vs Granite: rhyolite smaller minerals. Fine mineral has relatively more contact surface, so will weather faster. Only when granite is fractured it will have more interaction and weathering. 

Andesite vs Rhyolite groundwater. Both extrusive rocks. Similar contact surface. Andsite has a larger share of dark easy weatherable minerals. the TDS will be higher in an andesite

Basalt CO2 bubbles: Causes increased porosity. Effective porosity depends on weather these holes caused by CO2 are connected.

>Columnar basalt can be a good aquifer due to the wide cracks

# Hydrogeology of the Netherlands
North Sea Basin: started later than Paris and London Basin, but still very old. 

North Sea rather shallow due to collection of sediment as a result of its basin status. 

Approx 2.5mm decline per 100 years. 

Oceanic currents transport sediments from south-west to north-east

3000 years ago, rivers were blocked due to dunes. Therefore, very wet conditions and peat formation

6000 years ago, less blockage. Some peat, but also clay intrusion from the seas. Less sediment transport from the rivers, and therefore less sand deposited on the dunes. 

10.000 years ago: north sea mostly dry, rivers trying to deposit sediments southwards. 

20.000 years ago: weichselian ice age, which did not quite touch the Netherlands but caused our climate to be more like a tundra. 

90.000 years ago: Eemian interglacial: higher north sea level, intruding much further inland. 

140.000 years ago: Saalian ice age: large part of the Netherlands covered, somewhere halfway across.
