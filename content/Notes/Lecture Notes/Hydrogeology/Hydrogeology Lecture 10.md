# Groundwater in a Changing Climate
Interactions between groundwater and climate
- Decreasing groundwater recharge (P-ET, anthropogenic e.g. irrigation)
- Rising sea level and land subsidence

Battling or avoiding water shortage
- Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR)
- Soft engineering, e.g. sand dams

Taylor et al.:
- Direct impacts: declines in recharge (more uncertain than extremes in P and ET), sea level rise
- Indirect impacts: increased irrigation demands on groundwater because of stronger seasonality in stream flow, longer droughts due to an intensification of hydrological cycle. 

Groundwater storage is reduced by recharge rates dropping and groundwater abstraction increasing
- Dropping water tables
- Reductions in spring flow
- Overabstraction more likely

Sea level rise
- Melting ice caps
- Thermal expansion of water due to increasing temperature
- Fresh water outflow from groundwater abstraction

Consequences sea level rise
- Greater potential for ingress of saline groundwater in coastal zones. Encroachment of saline water into coastal fresh water reserves. Increasing hydraulic head differences.
