# Groundwater in a Changing Climate
Interactions between groundwater and climate
- Decreasing groundwater recharge (P-ET, anthropogenic e.g. irrigation)
- Rising sea level and land subsidence

Battling or avoiding water shortage
- Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR)
- Soft engineering, e.g. sand dams

Taylor et al.:
- Direct impacts: declines in recharge (more uncertain than extremes in P and ET), sea level rise
- Indirect impacts: increased irrigation demands on groundwater because of stronger seasonality in stream flow, longer droughts due to an intensification of hydrological cycle.
