What is hydrogeology?
- Groundwater hydrology, etc., all refer to the sciecne of water in the subsurface. This includes soils and rocks
- The study of occurrence, circulation, distribution and properties of any liquid residing...
- It is one of the two main branches of hydrology, alongside catchment hydrology. It deals with groundwater flow, quality, geothermal systems, petroleum hydrology, variable density systems, etc.

What is groundwater?
- Brittanica: Water that occurs below the surface of the earth, where it occupies all or part of the void spaces in soils or geologic strata.
- It is a type of geofluids, alongside for example liquid gas or oil
- It is a major part of the water cycle. It starts with surface or atmospheric water infiltrates in the subsurface. And ends as it discharges in a surface water body, in the atmosphere, or if it is extracted.
- We distinguish unsaturated and saturated groundwater. Unsaturated is gaps in soil filled with both water and air (also called vadose zone. Saturated is just air
- Groundwater table is there where pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and is boundary between saturated and unsaturated

We also have soil water. This is.... And capillary fringe.

Groundwater is vital for 
- food production. Irrigated aquaculture is the major user and consumer of groundwater.
- drinking water, both in rural and urban areas

We are overabstracting groundwater, which causes groundwater to decline. Mainly used for agriculture, and in Europe for domestic use. India is by far the country with the highest groundwater consumption in the world .

Groundwater resources in Europe are threatened
- Overabstraction
- Pollution

This leads to wetlands having an endangered status.

Meanwhile, groundwater supplied around 65% of all of Europe's drinking water

Sustainable yield relates to the water balance concept. Say a system has an upper and lower aquifer. We have inpyut as snowfall and precipitation, This evaporates, is transpired by crops, or goes as overland flow to the surface water. Part is recharged to the surface water. Part of the recharge, again, goes to surface water through baseflow. This is called environmental demands. Then, we have social-economic demand, such as water supply and irrigation

If the socio-economic demand is highier than the recharge minus the environmental demand, we have unsustainable yield / development. 

Consequences of groundwater depletion
- Agriculture increasingly deends irrigation waters as a result of dropping water tables
- Land-subsidence in unconsolidated aquifers due to reducing water pressure
- Increasing energy costs to ligt eater from deep aquifers
- Quality of pumped water deteriorates as deeper water is often saline
- Effluent water (baseflow) contributes to sea-level rise
- Adversely impact ecological sustainability, as it would decrease groundwater discharge to wetlands, rivers and drainage networks

Sustainable groundwater development needs to informed by sound hydrological understand. 
- Artificial recharge (irrigation losses, water returns)
- Natural recharge (excess rainfall, surface water seepage), Indirect recharge (aquitard leakage, cross-formational flow)

Artificial recharge / Managed aquifer recharge means saving water in rainy seasons, to let this recharge in dryer seasons. This is another

Outputs:
- Environmental benefits (e.g. groundwater discharge through baseflow, springs, wetlands, etc.)
- Social benefits (groundwater supply schemes such as drinking water supplies)
- Economic benefits (groundwater abstractions for agriculture and industry)

Again, these outputs are social-economic demands and ecological demands

Again, if social-economic demands are equal to recharge minus ecological demands, we have sustainable yield

Groundwater is held in aquifers, which consists of porous medium with properties favourable for the storage and flow of appreciable quantities of water. Or, an aquifer is a subsurface formation that contains and transmits water (i.e. groundwater) - it is a groundwater reservoir. This required 3 things
- It is porous
- It can store water
- It can transmit water

When hydrocarbons (gas or oil) are concerned, the term reservoir is commonly used instead of aquifer. 

An aquitard can store water and transmit it, but at a very low rate. It is a formation that retards but does not prevent flow of water to or from an adjacent aquifer. 

An aquiclude is a formation that does not transmit groundwater at all. It can store a tiny bit of water, but does not transmit it at all. 

All of these are subsurface formations

A confined aquifer is an aquifer between two aquitards or an aquitard and an aquiclude. It is restricted by a confining layer above it

An unconfined aquifer, or water table aquifer, is directly tied to the water table. It is also known as a phreatic aquifer. It is not restricted by a confining layer above it. It is free to rise and fall freely, due to fluctuations in the water table. 

If you dig a well in an unconfined aquifer, the water level will be the same as the water table. If you dig a well in a confined aquifer, the water table will be higher, because the water is under pressure. 

When water pressure is so high that water rises till above the surface, we speak of Artesian wells. 

We also have semi-confined, or leaky aquifers. A semi-confined aquifer is bounded by an aquitard that does transmit water when hydraulic head above and below the leaky boundary are in dis-equilibrium. For example, if the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer is higher than the confined aquifer, this confined aquifer becomes semi-confined, because the aquitard above it becomes able to transmit water more easily, and the confined-aquif
