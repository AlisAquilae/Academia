What is hydrogeology?
- Groundwater hydrology, etc., all refer to the sciecne of water in the subsurface. This includes soils and rocks
- The study of occurrence, circulation, distribution and properties of any liquid residing...
- It is one of the two main branches of hydrology, alongside catchment hydrology. It deals with groundwater flow, quality, geothermal systems, petroleum hydrology, variable density systems, etc.

What is groundwater?
- Brittanica: Water that occurs below the surface of the earth, where it occupies all or part of the void spaces in soils or geologic strata.
- It is a type of geofluids, alongside for example liquid gas or oil
- It is a major part of the water cycle. It starts with surface or atmospheric water infiltrates in the subsurface. And ends as it discharges in a surface water body, in the atmosphere, or if it is extracted.
- We distinguish unsaturated and saturated groundwater. Unsaturated is gaps in soil filled with both water and air (also called vadose zone. Saturated is just air
- Groundwater table is there where pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and is boundary between saturated and unsaturated

We also have soil water. This is.... And capillary fringe. 

Groundwater is vital for 
- food production. Irrigated aquaculture is the major user and consumer of groundwater.
- drinking water, both in rural and urban areas

We are overabstracting groundwater, which causes groundwater to decline. Mainly used for agriculture, and in Europe for domestic use. India is by far the country with the highest groundwater consumption in the world .

Groundwater resources in Europe are threatened
- Overabstraction
- Pollution

This leads to wetlands having an endangered status.

Meanwhile, groundwater supplied around 65% of all of Europe's drinking water

Sustainable yield relates to the water balance concept. Say a system has an upper and lower aquifer. We have inpyut as snowfall and precipitation, This evaporates, is transpired by crops, or goes as overland flow to the surface water. Part is recharged to the surface water. Part of the recharge, again, goes to surface water through baseflow. This is called environmental demands. Then, we have social-economic demand, such as water supply and irrigation

If the socio-economic demand is highier than the recharge minus the environmental demand, we have unsustainable yield.
