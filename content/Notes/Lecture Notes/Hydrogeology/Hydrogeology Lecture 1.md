What is hydrogeology?
- Groundwater hydrology, etc., all refer to the sciecne of water in the subsurface. This includes soils and rocks
- The study of occurrence, circulation, distribution and properties of any liquid residing...
- It is one of the two main branches of hydrology, alongside catchment hydrology. It deals with groundwater flow, quality, geothermal systems, petroleum hydrology, variable density systems, etc.

What is groundwater?
- Brittanica: Water that occurs below the surface of the earth, where it occupies all or part of the void spaces in soils or geologic strata.
- It is a type of geofluis, alongside for example liquid gas or oil
- It is a major part of the water cycle. It stsrts with surface or atmospheric water infiltrates in the subsurface. And ends as it discharges in a surface water body, in the atmosphere, or if it is extracted.
- We distinguish unsaturated and saturated groundwater. Unsaturated is gaps in soil filled with both water and air (also called vadose zone. Saturated is just air
- Groundwater table is there where pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and is boundary between saturated and unsaturated
