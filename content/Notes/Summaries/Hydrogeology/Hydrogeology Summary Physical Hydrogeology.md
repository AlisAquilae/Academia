# 1. Porosity
The [[Porosity]] of a soil or rock is that fraction of a given volume of material that is occupied by void space, or interstices. Porosity, indicated by the symbol $n$, is usually expressed as the ratio of the volume of voids, $V_v$, to the total unit volume, $V_t$. of a soil or rock, such that 

$$
n = \frac{V_v}{V_t} \tag{1.1}
$$

>Porosity can be determined in the laboratory from knowledge of the bulk mass density, $\rho_b$, and particle mass density, $\rho_s$, of the porous material using the relationship

Porosity is closely associated with the [[Void Ratio]], $e$, the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of the solid material, $V_s$, such that

$$
e = \frac{V_v}{V_s} \tag{1.2}
$$

The relation between porosity and the void ratio can be expressed as 

$$
n = \frac{e}{(1+e)} \tag{1.3a}
$$

or

$$
e = \frac{n}{(1-n)} \tag{1.3b}
$$
