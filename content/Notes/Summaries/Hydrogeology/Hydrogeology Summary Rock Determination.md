# The Basics
There are 3 main groups of rocks:
1. Igneous rocks
   1. Intrusive: Magmatic rocks
   2. Extrusive: Volcanic rocks
2. Sedimentary rocks
   1. Unconsolidated: Sediments
   2. Consolidated: Sedimentary rocks
3. Metamorphic rocks

These rock groups are often given in a rock cycle. At the bottom of the cycle (with the highest temperature and pressure) you find magma. The material can follow the cycle clockwise via igneous rocks, sediments, sedimentary rocks, via metamorphic rocks back to magma, but it can also take some shortcuts.

# Parts of the Rock Cycle
## Magma
Magma is a liquid mixture of silicates and oxides with different melting points. The base material for the melted rock is always metamorphic rock with a certain mineral composition. Given this mineral composition, the temperature (and pressure) and time it takes to melt a rock, differences can be identified in the chemical composition of lava.

Most of the magma is produced in the Earth crust, where the most frequent particles present are oxygen and silica. This makes sense, because they are the basis of almost all mineral structures.

The standard configuration of silica and oxygen dominated materials (silicates) is $\ce{SiO4}$, which is a pyramid like structure, with in the centre $\ce{Si}$ and at the four corners $\ce{O}$. This standard configuration is negatively charged, so metal atoms are added to
