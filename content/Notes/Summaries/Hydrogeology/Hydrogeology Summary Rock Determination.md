# The Basics
There are 3 main groups of rocks:
1. Igneous rocks
   1. Intrusive: Magmatic rocks
   2. Extrusive: Volcanic rocks
2. Sedimentary rocks
   1. Unconsolidated: Sediments
   2. Consolidated: Sedimentary rocks
3. Metamorphic rocks

These rock groups are often given in a rock cycle. At the bottom of the cycle (with the highest temperature and pressure) you find magma. The material can follow the cycle clockwise via igneous rocks, sediments, sedimentary rocks, via metamorphic rocks back to magma, but it can also take some shortcuts.

# Parts of the Rock Cycle
## Magma
Magma is a liquid mixture of silicates and oxides with different melting points. The base material for the melted rock is always metamorphic rock with a certain mineral composition. Given this mineral composition, the temperature (and pressure) and time it takes to melt a rock, differences can be identified in the chemical composition of lava.

Most of the magma is produced in the Earth crust, where the most frequent particles present are oxygen and silica. This makes sense, because they are the basis of almost all mineral structures.

The standard configuration of silica and oxygen dominated materials (silicates) is $\ce{SiO4}$, which is a pyramid like structure, with in the centre $\ce{Si}$ and at the four corners $\ce{O}$. This standard configuration is negatively charged, so metal atoms are added to neutralize the mineral. This makes the mineral (in general) dark coloured. At the other end of the spectrum, all oxygen atoms are shared with another silica atom. This brings a pyramid structure with one silica and four shared oxygen atoms which all bring one negative charge to the structure (instead of two). The relative share $\ce{SI}$ and $\ce{O}$ is then $\ce{SiO2}$. This structure is neutral so does not have to be neutralized by metal atoms. This makes the mineral (in general) light coloured

>The group of minerals which have $\ce{SiO4}$ as a basis is called the [[Olivine Group]]. When the pyramid structures are linked in a single string they are part of the [[Pyroxene Group]], and when they are linked in a double ring they belong to the [[Amphibole Group]]. 


>[!Important]
>When the oxygen sharing increases, then the strong chemical bindings increase, which make the mineral stronger (more difficult to weather them). The [[Phyllosilicates]] have strong chemical bindings in two dimensions and weak Van der Waals bindings in the third dimension. These are platy materials. When all oxygen atoms are shared it makes the [[Tectosilicates]] with strong bindings in all three dimensions. 


## Igneous Rocks
All these different mineral-compositions can be captured in a single simplified figure.

On the x-axis you find the percentage of $\ce{SiO2}$ in the melt. At the right hand side of the scale there is about 40% of $\ce{SiO2}$ and thus 60% of minerals with a higher share of oxygen (in the direction to or at $\ce{SiO4}$). At the left hand side of the scale there is even 70% of $\ce{SiO2}$ and only 30% with a higher share of oxygen. 

As we can see, the olivine, pyroxene, amphibole and biotite groups are considered to be dark coloured minerals and the quartz and felspar groups are considered to be light coloured minerals.
