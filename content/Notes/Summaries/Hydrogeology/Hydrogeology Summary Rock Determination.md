# The Basics
There are 3 main groups of rocks:
1. Igneous rocks
   1. Intrusive: Magmatic rocks
   2. Extrusive: Volcanic rocks
2. Sedimentary rocks
   1. Unconsolidated: Sediments
   2. Consolidated: Sedimentary rocks
3. Metamorphic rocks

These rock groups are often given in a rock cycle. At the bottom of the cycle (with the highest temperature and pressure) you find magma. The material can follow the cycle clockwise via igneous rocks, sediments, sedimentary rocks, via metamorphic rocks back to magma, but it can also take some shortcuts.

# Parts of the Rock Cycle
## Magma
Magma is a liquid mixture of silicates and oxides with different melting points. The base material for the melted rock is always metamorphic rock with a certain mineral composition. Given this mineral composition, the temperature (and pressure) and time it takes to melt a rock, differences can be identified in the chemical composition of lava.

Most of the magma is produced in the Earth crust, where the most frequent particles present are oxygen and silica. This makes sense, because they are the basis of almost all mineral structures.

The standard configuration of silica and oxygen dominated materials (silicates) is $\ce{SiO4}$, which is a pyramid like structure, with in the centre $\ce{Si}$ and at the four corners $\ce{O}$. This standard configuration is negatively charged, so metal atoms are added to neutralize the mineral. This makes the mineral (in general) dark coloured. At the other end of the spectrum, all oxygen atoms are shared with another silica atom. This brings a pyramid structure with one silica and four shared oxygen atoms which all bring one negative charge to the structure (instead of two). The relative share $\ce{SI}$ and $\ce{O}$ is then $\ce{SiO2}$. This structure is neutral so does not have to be neutralized by metal atoms. This makes the mineral (in general) light coloured

>[!Important]
>The group of minerals which have $\ce{SiO4}$ as a basis is called the [[Olivine Group]]. When the pyramid structures are linked in a single string they are part of the [[Pyroxene Group]], and when they are linked in a double ring they belong to the [[Amphibole Group]]. 


>[!Important]
>When the oxygen sharing increases, then the strong chemical bindings increase, which make the mineral stronger (more difficult to weather them). The [[Phyllosilicates]] have strong chemical bindings in two dimensions and weak Van der Waals bindings in the third dimension. These are platy materials. When all oxygen atoms are shared it makes the [[Tectosilicates]] with strong bindings in all three dimensions. 


## Igneous Rocks
All these different mineral-compositions can be captured in a single simplified figure. 

![[Pasted image 20241022152301.png]]

On the x-axis you find the percentage of $\ce{SiO2}$ in the melt. At the right hand side of the scale there is about 40% of $\ce{SiO2}$ and thus 60% of minerals with a higher share of oxygen (in the direction to or at $\ce{SiO4}$). At the left hand side of the scale there is even 70% of $\ce{SiO2}$ and only 30% with a higher share of oxygen. 

As we can see, the olivine, pyroxene, amphibole and biotite groups are considered to be dark coloured minerals and the quartz and felspar groups are considered to be light coloured minerals. 

### Intrusive Rocks
We can make a distinction between intrusive (magmatic) and extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks. The difference between the two lies in the time the rocks have to cool down. Intrusive rocks are stuck inside the earth and will therefore cool down slowly. When it comes to surface it will cool down relatively fast, and is called extrusive. Differences between the two in mineral composition are due to the time-difference the magma has had to cool down. Intrusive rocks cool down slowly, enabling minerals to grow; extrusive rocks cool down fast, resulting in a rock with small minerals.

Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are
- Granite
- Diorite
- Gabbro

### Extrusive Rocks
As explained above, extrusive (volcanic) rocks were formed by lava coming to the surface and cooling down relatively quickly. Therefore, it had not much time to form large (visible) minerals. Even though the chemical composition can be identical to the intrusive equivalent, the colour of the rock is duller.

Examples of extrusive rocks are
- Rhyolite (not very common, because lava with this chemical composition has a high viscosity, and therefore most lava will solidify inside the earth and become granite)
- Andesite
- Basalt
- Tuff

## Sedimentary Rocks
These rocks develop from other rocks, like igneous, metamorphic or even sedimentary rock under the influence of exogenic processes. These are the processes at the earth surface like weathering, transport and deposition by wind, water, ice and organisms. Some sedimentary rocks are weathered, transported and deposited only once. 
- When material is weathered, eroded and sedimented only once it is called a monocyclic sediment
- When there is repetition of weathering, transportation and deposition, the result is called a polycyclic sediment. In these polycyclic sediments often the easily weatherable dark minerals are gone and only the poor quartz and some felspars remain. 

>[!Note]
>If a material is only weathered, but not (yet) transported and deposited it is not called a sediment but a regolith layer

In sedimentary rocks three groups can be distinguished:
1. [[Clastic Sediments]]: particles transported by water, ice or wind, or a combination of the three. These are formed by all sediments that originate from transport processes, so from clay to gravel layers
2. Chemical Sediments: Precipitated from oversaturated solutions. For example iron ore, halite, gypsum (and some limestones)
3. Organic Sediments: From organic material (flora, fauna). For example some limestones, peat and (brown) coal

The process of diagenesis / lithification / solidification refers to rocks becoming harder and firmer, meaning they can only be broken by a hammer. The mineral composition is often changed in the process as well. Lithification will gradually change, with increasing temperature and pressure, into metamorphose. As the boundary normally a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius is used. 

There are two types of diagenesis:
1. Reduction of volume: this is reached by the compression / compaction or though solution at large depth
2. Mineralogical changes: these are the result of chemical processes between pore water and the minerals, often as cementing. The cementing process during diagenesis consists of the removal of water from the pores and the filling of the pores with new formed minerals. 

The fossils in the rock material will not be influenced by the diagenesis. The presence of fossils is therefore a nice difference between diagenesis and metamorphism

### Clastic Sediments
Examples of solid (consolidated) sedimentary rocks are:
- Coarse
  - Conglomerate (rounded rock fragments)
  - Breccia (angular rock fragments)
- Moderately coarse
  - Sandstone (from sand)
  - Arkose (coarse sandstone with a lot of felspar)
  - Grauwacke (idem, but less felspar)
- Fine
  - Siltstone (from silt)
  - Schale (from clay)

Consolidated rocks, which are constructed from particles in the size of the sand fraction (63 $\mu$m to 2 mm), can be described as arenite (psammite), independent of the composition of these particles. A sandstone thus belongs to this group, but also arkose and grauwacke. The rocks with particles smaller than the sand fraction are also called lutite (pelite). 

>[!Info]
>The names lutite, siltstone and shale are often used for the same material.

For rocks with particles larger than the sand fraction, the conglomerate and breccia, are called rudite (psephite). 

The vast majority (99%) of the sediments in the world consists of the different forms of sand, clay and chalk/limestone

## Metamorphic Rock
Matter (elements as well as compounds) can develop totally different properties under changing temperature and pressure. The visible characteristics and the physical properties can be very different. 

Rocks can, because of the increase of temperature and pressure, reach the limit of stability. Their specific  form then gets unstable. The in the original mineral abundant atoms will search for a configuration that is stable under the new conditions. It is important to realize that metamorphosis is a process in solid rock. Since the mobility of ions in solid rock is extremely slow, this is a very slow process. This is in contrast to a chemical reaction in a fluid or gas. 

Because of the total recrystallization during the metamorphose also the fossils in the rock will be part of the metamorphose. In metamorphic rocks there are thus never fossils.

Metamorphose is in fact the stadium between diagenesis and the melting of the rocks

>[!Important]
>When a rock melts completely and cools down again it does not belong to the metamorphic rocks anymore, but to the magmatic rocks. This because only the chemical composition resembles the original rock


The minerals of metamorphic rock experience during their metamorphose often a high and directed pressure. This results in layered structures. Common examples are:
- Slate: a fine-grained rock, developed from clay, with a strong cleavage preference in one direction (low-graded metamorphose)
- Phyllite: Slightly coarser rock than slate with a silvery or greenish lustre.
- Schist: A rather coarse-grained rock with parallel structures and clearly visible micas
- Gneiss: Coarse grained with clearly visible parallel structures of micas and felspars, characterized by a coarse layering. High grade metamorphose
