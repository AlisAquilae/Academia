# 1. Lowlands
## 1.1 Accumulation- and Coastal Areas
Accumulation- or coastal areas are commonly subsiding sedimentary basins where thick unconsolidated sediment piles have accumulated. Examples are: the Netherlands, Northern Germany and the Ganges delta in Bangladesh. The Netherlands has been a subsiding 
sedimentary basin for millions of years. The result is that the older formations are located at large depth. The sedimentary basin is predominantly filled with marine deposits (clay, silt and fine sand). In the pores connate salt water occurs (connate (Latin: ’born with’) water i.e. water that was part of the original sediment at the time of deposition). Only during Quaternary (from Tiglian, approx. 2 million years ago) in the Netherlands predominantly fluviatile sedimentation occurs, when the climate showed an alternation of colder and warmer periods. These deposits, which are some hundreds of meters thick in the central part of the Netherlands, vary from clay to coarse sand and gravel.

The coastal deposits have a high total porosity. The effective porosity and conductivity is predominantly low as a result of the large volume of fine grained sediments. Only dunes, ‘sea dunes’ and high-water line deposits have a fairly high conductivity. In a large part of the deposits the pores are filled with salt water. That water can originate from the forming of the sedimentary rock (connate water) or entered this sedimentary formation later as a result of the differences in level between the sea and the polders.

>The replacement of fresh water by salt water is a very slow process, that takes thousands to ten thousands of years. At many locations this replacement is not completed, so large quantities of fresh water can still be found under the sea floor

In the dunes during Holocene a fresh water-lens on top of the salt water was formed. Two  
main causes can be given. 
1. The first is that the dunes show topography: they are higher than their surroundings. It is therefore possible to generate a convexity that reaches higher than the sea level. The groundwater recharge can then be discharged as groundwater. When the dune area would not have a surface level higher than the sea level, the groundwater table would have reached surface level and therefore the precipitation excess would have been discharged via a shallow drainage pattern. 
2. A second reason for the development of a fresh water lens is the fairly high conductivity of the dune sands. As a result no overland flow occurs, and groundwater recharge can take place. 

The dunes are an important groundwater body in lowland coastal areas as a result of this fresh water lens.

The depth of the fresh water lens ($z$ in m) below sea level is according to the [[Ghyben-Herzberg Principle]] equal to:

$$
z = \frac{\rho_f}{\rho_s - \rho_f}h_f
$$

in which
- $\rho_f$ is the fresh water density
- $\rho_s$ is the salt water density
- $h_f$ is the convexity of the groundwater table

Assuming a density of the salt and fresh groundwater of respectively 1025 and 1000 the thickness of the fresh water lens can be calculated as $z=40h_f$. Thus, with a convexity of only a few meters, fresh water lenses underneath coastal areas can possibly be several hundreds of meters thick
