# 1. Catchment Characteristics
## 1.1 Introduction
The [[Catchment]], also called [[Catchment|Basin]], [[Catchment|Drainage Basin]] or [[Catchment|Watershed]]) of a river is the area from which excess water flows towards that river. 

Every catchment has characteristics which determine the hydrological processes that occur. When these characteristics change, for example when urbanisation increases the percentage of paved surfaces or when forests are removed, different processes may occur, leading to higher or lower discharges in the river. 

>[!Summary]
>This section introduces catchments and the three most important landscape characteristics:
>1. Topography
>2. Land cover
>3. Geology

In [[#4. Rainfall-Runoff Processes]] these landscape characteristics are linked to hydrological processes. 

---
## 1.2 Identifying Catchments
### 1.2.1 Catchment Delineation
While not specified, the catchment of a river or stream is the area draining towards the river's **outlet** (or [[Debouchment]]), which is at the sea or when the river joins a larger river. 

>[!Note]
>The catchment can also be defined upstream of a measurement station or any point of interest (city, nature area, etc.)

Determining the catchment boundary (or [[Water Divide]]) is called [[Catchment Delineation]] and can be done in several ways

1. **The Surface Water Divide** is found by following the river channels upstream until their sources and drawing the divide between the channels leading to the outlet and the channels leading to another river. 
2. **The Topographical Water Divide** is found by looking at the topography of the area. This is based on the idea that water follows the highest points in the landscape. This can, however, deviate from the actual water divide, because infiltrating water may hit an impermeable layer in the ground and be led in another direction.
3. **The Groundwater Divide** looks at groundwater flows, and therefore focuses on geological characteristics. The difference between the topographical water divide and the actual water divide is often caused by groundwater, and is therefore least accurate in catchments with a high contribution of groundwater flows. 

>[!Note]
>In many places, people have changed the course of groundwater and surface water flow, changing the catchment boundary. For example, the catchment boundaries of polders are often dikes. 
### 1.2.2 Zones
When going downstream, water of an increasing area is discharged: the catchment extent increases in the downstream direction. 

In general, we can divide the catchment area of a river, from source to outlet, in 3 [[Catchment Zoning|zones]]:
1. Zone 1 is the **upper course** or upstream area, which consists of various sub-catchments with a dense dendritic (tree-shaped) network of channels. We call this area the [[Production Zone]], because this is the main region where the surface water and sediments are formed. 
2. Zone 2 is the **middle course**, which consists of a distinguished main channel which often meanders through the landscape. This main channel only has a few branches. We call this area the [[Transport Zone]] because sediment is transported downstream.
3. Zone 3 is the **lower course** or downstream area. This is the delta where the river divides into multiple branches again as a result of the flat landscape, and as a result of the large amount of water and sediment present in the river. We call this area the [[Deposition Zone]], because the low flow velocity causes sediment to settle

## 1.3 Landscape Characteristics
### 1.3.1 Topography
The topography (variation in elevation) plays an important role in the formation and transport of surface water. The appearance of the current channels in (mostly) natural catchments is the result of erosion and sedimentation which have taken place over thousands of years, under the influence of the past and present climate. 

Topography determines partly which areas within a catchment are relatively wet and vulnerable to flooding. The [[Draining Area]] of a certain point in the landscape is the surface water uphill (above that point and up to the water divide) because water from that area all flows towards that point. If the draining area is large, a large amount of water has to pass by this point, increasing the wetness (and flood risk). Similarly, if the slope of the land surface at that point is high, the water flows quickly, reducing wetness and flood risk. 

The ratio between the draining area and the local slope is called the [[Topographic Wetness Index]]. At locations with a high topographic wetness index, ponds form and channels begin. 
$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{draining area}}{\text{local slope}}  \tag{1.1} 
$$
Hillslopes can be classified based on their shape and slope.
- A hillslope shaped like a funnel is known as a **converging hillslope**, because all water is led to one point
- A **diverging hillslope** spread the water out more, leading to a generally less wet area
- A **parallel hillslope** is neither converging nor diverging
- **Straight hillslopes** have the same slope everywhere
- **Concave hillslopes** (shaped like a hollow) have higher slopes at the top and lower at the bottom, which increases the wetness and flood risk at the bottom
- **Convex hillslopes** (rounded) have lower slopes near the top and higher near the bottom, decreasing the wetness at the bottom.

![[Pasted image 20240217185429.jpg]]

>[!Question]
>A certain plant species prefers wet conditions. Are these plants more likely to be found at the bottom of a concave parallel hillslope or at the bottom of a convex parallel hillslope?
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>The draining area is the same for both hillslopes, but the local slope is lower at the bottom of the concave hillslope, leading to a higher Topographic Wetness Index and better conditions for this plant species there

### 1.3.2 Land Cover
Most of the land surface is covered by vegetation, either natural or planted. The presence and type of vegetation impact hydrological processes. Leaves intercept rain water, roots extract water from the ground and water can seep into the ground more easily near stems. Areas that are intensively used by people often have additional means to discharge excess water (such as drainpipes, ditches and sewage systems). Therefore, information how the land is used helps to predict which hydrological processes occur and how discharge responds to rainfall

### 1.3.3 Geology
The subsurface plays a major role in storing and transporting water in catchments. The properties of the soil or rocks determine how much water can be stored and how fast water will flow underground.

For catchment hydrology, the major soil properties are [[Porosity]] and [[Permeability|Conductivity]] (also called [[Permeability]]).

The [[Porosity]] is the fraction of open spaces between soil particles and determines how much water can be stored in the ground. 

The [[Permeability]] is a measure of how easy it is for the water to flow between soil particles and determines how quickly water is transported

>[!note]
>Both are explained in more detail later on in the reader

Porosity and conductivity are determines by the size, shape and origin of the soil particles.
- **Gravel** (very large particles) has a very high conductivity
- **Sand** (large particles) has a high conductivity
- **Clay** (small particles) has a low conductivity

The porosity is highest for clay and lowest for gravel, but the differences between soil types are less distinct than for the conductivity. 

>[!Important]
>While both [[Porosity]] and [[Permeability]] influence the ability of water to move through a soil, they do not necessarily move hand in hand. There might be spaces between soil particles, indicating that the porosity is high, but these spaces do not have to be connected. This is the case in, for example, clay sheets. Another example is peat, which has a very high porosity but a low conductivity because it consists of partly composed plant material which fixates water

Soil particles were deposited under certain environmental conditions in the past, which is now visible in layers of varying soil types. A layer of permeable soil is called an [[Aquifer]] and can store and transport water well. Under the layer(s) of soil (loose material) is the bedrock (solid rocks). In mountainous areas, the soil can be just a thin layer or completely absent and the soil depth (or depth to bedrock) is an important factor for determining a catchment's response to rainfall. 

>[!Note]
>Water can be stored in rocks and flow through it, but the permeability and conductivity are often low, unless there are cracks.

>[!Note]
>In lowland areas the bedrock can be hundreds of meters deep and does not affect hydrology

# 2. Channels
## 2.1 Introduction
The surface of a [[Catchment]] can be divided into land (hillslopes and flat land) and water (channels and lakes). Similar to the catchment characteristics discussed in [[Reader Water 1-Chapter 1.1-Catchment Characteristics|Chapter 1.1]], the channel network is both the result of landscape formation in the past ([[Geomorphology]], and the preferred route for water flow in the present (**Topology**).

This chapter contains 2 methods to classify channel networks: the [[Drainage Density]] and pattern analysis.

---
## 2.2 Drainage Density
The [[Drainage Density]] $D_d$ (km $\cdot$ km$^{-2}$ or km$^{-1}$) quantifies the abundance of channels: 

$$
D_d = \frac{L_{\text{tot}}}{A}\tag{2.1}
$$

Where
- $L_{\text{tot}}$ (m) = the total length of all channels in a certain area $A$
- $A$ (m$^2$) = The chosen area (typically a catchment)

>[!Important]
>A high drainage density indicates that a certain area contains many channels (per km$^2$). 

Consequently, the average distance from a location on land to the nearest channel is small. Water only has to travel a small distance over and through the ground to the surface of water networks

If you want to know the average distance of a catchment between the channel and the nearest hill (assuming this hill forms a water divide), you can use the following formula: 

$$
B=\frac{1}{D_d} \tag{2.2}
$$

Where
- $B$ is the effective width of the catchment
- $D_d$ is the [[Drainage Density]]

>[!Note]
>Climate, geology, soil, land cover and human activities affect the drainage density

>[!Info]
>In temperate climates, $D_d$ is about 1.5 km$^{-1}$ for natural areas, meaning that 1.5 km of channel is necessary to drain a catchment with an area of 1 km$^2$. In wet climates, more water has to be drained, leading to the formation of more channels and a high drainage density. 

Drainage densities are also high in areas with low soil [[Permeability|Conductivity]]. If it is difficult for water to flow through the ground, water has to flow over the ground and if that happens often, a channel is shaped. Agricultural areas also have a high (man-made) drainage density, especially in lowland areas where shallow groundwater needs to be discharged quickly.

---
## 2.3 Drainage Pattern Analysis
Natural channel networks can have various patterns, which often relate to the geology. Examples include:
- The **dendritic pattern**, which is present in landscapes with homogeneous geological formations (either soil or rock), and contains many tributaries (branches)
- The **radial pattern**, where streams start from one central point and flow in all directions. This pattern is often seen on volcanoes and other mountains. 
- The **trellis pattern**, which is often found in areas with folds in the earth crust. The river pattern is characterised by a relatively large number of channels that have the same direction on each side of the river
- The **parallel pattern** occurs on step slopes, where the water flows downhill fast.

![[Pasted image 20240217185929.jpg]]

>[!Info]
>Natural channel networks are organised efficiently because nature strives for minimal energy use and an equal energy distribution over the entire system. Although different shapes of river networks occur, the most common one is the dendritic Pattern (tree shaped). This shape is often present in natural forms, such as veins on leaves, lightning, blood veins and lungs, showing that this pattern is the most efficient for transport of a variety of substances

---
## 2.4 Network Ordering
Channels that are located in the [[Headwater]] (upstream part) of a catchment behave differently from channels further downstream:
- They run dry more often
- The chemistry of the stream water is only determined by local conditions (and not influenced by water coming from upstream)

To distinguish these types of channels, [[Network Ordering]] can be applied. 

The channel network can be divided into:
- **Links** (channel segments) 
- **Junctions** (locations where channels merge). 
- A **source** is a location upstream where a channel starts. 
- Links between a source and the first junction are called **exterior links**
- Links between two junctions are called **interior links**
- The [[Debouchment|Outlet]] is the end-point downstream

A common network ordering method is [[Strahler Order Numbering]]. Its rules are:
1. All exterior links get the order 1
2. When links of the same order merge, add one for the link downstream of the junction (e.g. two order 2's merge into an order 3)
3. When links with a different order merge, the link downstream of the junction will have the same order as the highest order of the merging links (e.g. when an order 1 and an order 3 stream merge, the downstream link is a 3rd order stream)
4. The highest order is always found at the outlet and represents the **Strahler Order** of the catchment

# 3. Climate
## 3.1 Introduction
Rivers are fed by precipitation ($P$, mostly rain and snow). Some of that water (sometimes all) is used for [[Evapotranspiration]] ($ET$) and the remainder is the [[Effective Precipitation]]: the water that will eventually be discharged by rivers. 

>[!Important]
>Precipitation, evapotranspiration and discharge are the most important fluxes in a catchment

Since the amounts of precipitation and evapotranspiration vary in time and space, the effective precipitation and discharge vary as well. Climate and weather determine to a large extent the discharge dynamics and knowing the amount and distribution of precipitation and evapotranspiration is crucial to predict discharges. 

---
## 3.2 Precipitation
### 3.2.1 Precipitation Types
Precipitation can occur in various forms: as rain, snow, hail, fog or dew. 

Two types of precipitation can be distinguished
- [[Stratiform Precipitation]]: often occurs in winters in temperate climates and it is characterised by prolonged periods of extensive areas with a low precipitation intensity. Stratiform clouds are wide and relatively thin blankets with homogeneous gray or white colours.
- [[Convective Precipitation]]: often occurs in tropical climates and summers in temperate climates and is characterised by short-term, intensive showers on a local scale. The belonging clouds are small and towering, with vertical structures formed by the upward movement of the water droplets

### 3.2.2 Spatial Variation in Precipitation
Spatial variability in precipitation is caused by several factors. On the hourly and daily timescale, the size and shape of the clouds from which the rain or snow falls determine the variability. Stratiform precipitation has a low spatial variability and convective precipitation has a high spatial variability.

Looking at longer timescales (months or years), precipitation is high downwind of areas where much water evaporates: oceans and large lakes, and, to a lesser extent, rainforests and wetlands. Precipitation is also high on the windward side of mountains because clouds are forced upwards, where the air is colder and water vapour turns into water droplets (condensation) or ice particles (deposition). The smaller amount of precipitation on the downside of the mountain (leeward side) is called the [[Rain Shadow]]. 

>[!Note]
>Even a slightly hilly area such as the Dutch Veluwe shows this effect on the precipitation distribution.

>[!Info]
>The average annual precipitation over the whole land surface of the Earth is in the order of 1000 mm y$^{-1}$ (which can be seen as a water layer of 1m depth), varying between nearly 0 in the Sahel and Gobi deserts to more than 2000 mm y$^{-1}$ in tropical rainforests and in the Himalayas. In Europe the average annual precipitation sum ranges from about 300 to 2500 mm y$^{-1}$, with low values in Spain and high values in the Alps and west coasts of Norway, the UK, Iceland and Northern Portugal. In the Netherlands, the average annual precipitation ranges from about 750 mm y$^{-1}$ in northern Limburg to 950 mm y$^{-1}$ on the Veluwe

### 3.2.3 Temporal Variation in Precipitation
Precipitation happens during precipitation events (also called showers or storms), which last from several minutes to hours or days, with dry spells in between. Dry spells are especially long in semi-arid climates, where most rain falls during short and intense showers. 

In most areas, precipitation varies seasonally. For example, in large areas in Southeast Asia, northern Australia and West-Africa most rain falls during several months in the Monsoon season. In the Netherlands there is hardly any variation in the precipitation sums between winter and summer, but the precipitation type and intensity does vary.

There is also variation between years (inter-annual variability).

Climate change affects both the average annual precipitation sum and the type of precipitation. 
### 3.2.4 Precipitation Measurement Techniques
#### 3.2.4.1 Rain Gauges
Rain is often measured with rain gauges. The most common gauges collect the water in a reservoir, its volume is measured (automatically or manually) and divided by the surface area of the gauge to obtain a rainfall sum in mm. 

A tipping bucket gauge leads the rain to a small reservoir, which tips when it holds a certain amount of water. The tipping moments are registered and the precipitation amounts and intensities can be calculated.

Heated gauges are used in cold areas to melt snow and measure the liquid water

Rain gauge measurements are strongly influenced by wind: rain droplets are blown over the gauge and rainfall is underestimated, especially when gauges are place high above the ground (where wind is stronger) or near obstacles.

#### 3.2.4.2 Radar
Rain gauges measure at one location, but this may not be representative of a whole catchment. A weather radar can sense the location and severity of a precipitation event tens of km around the instrument. Radio waves are sent into the atmosphere and reflected by water droplets and ice particles. The reflected percentage of the radio waves can be converted to precipitation intensity. A disadvantage of radars is that they measure precipitation high above the land surface, which can be much less that on the ground. Therefore, the radar images are often corrected using gauge measurements. 

---
## 3.3 Evapotranspiration
### 3.3.1 Energy Balance
[[Evapotranspiration]] is the transition from liquid water to water vapour and requires much energy. This energy is provided by the sun in the form of short-wave radiation, which is partly reflected by the land surface. The fraction of sunlight that is reflected, is called the [[Albedo]] and depends on the land cover. The earth emits long-wave radiation, which is partly reflected back to earth by clouds. The difference between incoming and outgoing radiation (both short- and long-wave radiation) at the earth surface is called the net-radiation.

The net radiation at the land surface is divided between the [[Sensible Heat Flux]] (heating the land surface and air), [[Latent Heat Flux]] (evapotranspiration) and soil heat flux (heating the ground below). This is called the [[Energy Balance Model|Energy Balance]].

### 3.3.2 Evapotranspiration Components

>[!Important]
>The total [[Evapotranspiration]] (ET) of an area consists of 
>1. Transpiration 
>2. Interception evaporation
>3. Soil evaporation
>4. Open water evaporation.

#### 3.3.2.1 Transpiration
Plant roots extract water from the soil to transport nutrients to their leaves. A small amount of water is used for photosynthesis, but most is lost to the air through **transpiration**, when plants open their stomata (openings on the leaves) to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen with the air. Plants are able to regulate the size of the opening of their stomata, which affects transpiration
#### 3.3.2.2 Interception Evaporation
**Interception evaporation** is the evaporation of precipitation which falls on the vegetation, but that will never reach the soil, because it evaporates directly from the leaves, stems and branches. This form of evaporation is short-term and only occurs on days with precipitation. Since this form of evaporation does not have the resistance caused by stomata (as it occurs with transpiration), interception evaporation is a faster process than transpiration.
#### 3.3.2.3 Soil Evaporation
**Soil evaporation** is the evaporation from a moist soil. Without new precipitation, this flux will decrease each day. The temporal scale of soil evaporation is between that of transpiration and interception evaporation. 
#### 3.3.2.4 Open Water Evaporation
Similarly, evaporation from lakes or rivers is called **open water evaporation**

### 3.3.3 The Amount of Evapotranspiration
Net radiation fuels evapotranspiration, but it is not the only factor controlling the amount of ET. Firstly, other meteorological factors play a role: high air temperature, low air humidity and high wind speeds increase evapotranspiration. Warm air can contain more moisture, making it easier for water to evaporate. When air is dry, water can also evaporate more easily. When there is wind, the air near the surface that has become moist through evapotranspiration is refreshed with drier air. 

Secondly, evapotranspiration is influenced by land use. More water evaporates from vegetated surfaces: both transpiration and interception evaporation are higher. There are large differences between vegetation types as well.

Thirdly, when there is not enough water in the ground, the evapotranspiration can be lower than expected based on meteorological variables and land use. 

>[!Summary]
>Factors influencing the amount of evapotranspiration:
>1. Net radiation
>2. Other meteotrological factors (e.g. air temperature, air humidity and wind speeds)
>3. Land use
>4. Soil water

>[!Note]
>In the Netherlands, evapotranspiration is the most important outgoing flux of water in catchments. 

Evapotranspiration has a clear daily and seasonal pattern, which corresponds to the available solar radiation. The spatial variability in ET is caused by spatial variability in the controlling factors: meteorological factors vary gradually in space, land use can switch abruptly and soil moisture is influenced by water management. 
### 3.3.4 Evapotranspiration Measurement Techniques
[[Evapotranspiration]] is very difficult to measure. The most common instrument is the **evaporation pan**: a container with water in which the level is measured. The decrease in water level gives the open water evaporation, which can be used as estimate for evapotranspiration. In a **lysimeter** the container is filled with the soil and vegetation of the environment. The container is either weighed (the loss of mass is caused by ET) or the outflow at the bottom is measured. Lysimeters are more complex, expensive and require more maintenance than evaporation pans and are therefore used less often. 
### 3.3.5 Evapotranspiration Equations
In absence of good measurement techniques, people often use equations based on meteorological observations to estimate evapotranspiration. There are many of these equations, with different levels of accuracy and data requirements. The simplest requires only temperature, the equation used by the Dutch meteorological institute (the method of Makkink) uses incoming short-wave radiation and temperature, and more complex equations (e.g. the method of Penman) also use air humidity and wind speed.

These equations give the [[Reference Evapotranspiration]], which is the ET that theoretically could take place for the actual meteorological conditions over well-watered grassland (the conditions at most meteorological stations).

To obtain the [[Potential Evapotranspiration]], which is the ET that could take place for the actual meteorological conditions and local vegetation, assuming that this vegetation has enough water to transpire, the reference evapotranspiration should be multiplied with a crop factor ($f$): 

$$
ET_{\text{pot}}=f \cdot ET_{\text{ref}} \tag{3.1}
$$

The crop factor depends on the type of vegetation and varies seasonally

The [[Actual Evapotranspiration]] is the ET that occurs in reality, so for certain meteorological conditions for a certain land use and including possible water stress. Actual ET has to be determined from the potential evapotranspiration and the current soil moisture content in the rooting zone. The soil moisture can be determined from field measurements or computer models. 

| Evapotranspiration Types | Meteorological Conditions | Land Use | Soil Moisture |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Reference Evapotranspiration | Actual | Grassland | Optimal |
| Potential Evapotranspiration | Actual | Actual | Optimal |
| Actual Evapotranspiration | Actual | Actual | Actual |

# 4. Rainfall-Runoff Processes
## 4.1 Introduction
Water that falls on the land surface as precipitation and which does not evaporate can follow many routes towards the surface water network. The processes that determine these routes are called rainfall-runoff processes. Catchment characteristics and climate determine which processes are dominant and how fast the runoff responds to rainfall events

---
## 4.2 Interception
[[Interception]] is the storage of precipitation water on leaves, stems and branches of vegetation. The part of the rainwater which falls on vegetation but cannot be stored there is called [[Throughfall]]. Of the intercepted precipitation, a part can still reach the soil via [[Stemflow]]: the movement of water down the stems of the vegetation. The remaining part will evaporate. 

The maximum volume of water which the vegetation can intercept and store, the **interception capacity**, depends on the type of vegetation. A deciduous forest can store much more water than a grassland in summer. Hence, the maximum interception depends on the type of vegetation and its seasonal growing pattern. It also depends on the intensity, duration, frequency and type of precipitation. 

>[!Note]
>Humans can change vegetation characteristics (e.g. via deforestation), while precipitation characteristics change due to climate change. This is why hydrologists (and climatologists) develop simulation models of the interception process to estimate the effects of land use change and climate change on the hydrological cycle. 

>[!Info]
>Since the interception evaporation depends on the precipitation pattern, this form of evaporation is quite variable. This is why the interception evaporation is often explicitly accounted for in the calculation of forest evapotranspiration. 

---
## 4.3 Infiltration
The downward movement of water from the soil surface through the soil is called [[Infiltration]]. Infiltration determines the distribution of precipitation between storage on the surface (as ponds) and surface runoff on the one hand, subsurface storage (groundwater and soil moisture) and subsurface runoff (drainage) on the other hand.

>[!Info]
>The infiltration speed is the speed at which water moves through the soil. The infiltration speed is defined as a volume flux density: m$^3$ water per m$^2$ per time, which gives mm $\cdot$ h$^{-1}$ (with an extra unit conversion). The use of these units makes it possible to directly relate the infiltration speed to the precipitation intensity (also in  mm $\cdot$ h$^{-1}$). 

The infiltration speed varies. The maximum possible infiltration speed at a certain moment is called the [[Infiltration Capacity]]. When the precipitation intensity is below the infiltration capacity, all rain will infiltrate. When the precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity, some rain will not infiltrate and stay on the land surface

The infiltration capacity depends on land cover, soil type and soil wetness. The state of the upper soil layer (1-2 mm) has a large influence on the infiltration capacity. Pavement, for example, reduces the infiltration capacity drastically. Vegetation cover improves the stability and structure of the soil, which results in a higher and a more stable infiltration capacity.

Besides the state of the top soil, the water transportation capacity of the layer below this top layer is important for the downward transport of water. Therefore, sandy soils have higher infiltration capacities than clayey soils (unless they have cracks that occur when the clay dries and shrinks).

>[!Note]
>Generally, the infiltration capacity decreases during a rainfall event, when the topsoil becomes wetter, leaving less space for new water. However, the transportation capacity of the lower layer increases with soil wetness. When a soil becomes very dry, it can become hydrophobic (water resistant): the infiltration capacity is very small and most rain water will not infiltrate.

---
## 4.4 Percolation and Capillary Rise
Soils consist of soil particles (or [[Soil Matrix]]) and the pore space between the particles, which can be filled with water and air. The ratio of the pore space to the total volume is called the [[Porosity]] or pore fraction.

The [[Groundwater Table]] divides the soil into a [[Saturated Zone]] (the area below the groundwater table) and an [[Unsaturated Zone]] (above the groundwater table). 

In the saturated zone, all pores are completely filled with water. The water in this zone is called [[Groundwater]]. In the unsaturated zone, the pores are filled with both water and air. Water in the unsaturated zone is called [[Soil Moisture]] or soil water. Just above the groundwater table, a thin zone is present which is completely saturated. This zone is called the [[Capillary Fringe]].

Water that has infiltrated into the soil will move slowly downward through the unsaturated zone towards the saturated zone. This flow is called [[Percolation]] and is caused by gravity. When the groundwater table is shallow, the opposite can occur: [[Capillary Rise]]. Water is 'sucked' upwards by a negative pressure which is caused by evapotranspiration in the top soil. 

Percolation through the soil matrix is a slow process. However, there are often macropores such as cracks in clay soils or rocks in animal burrows which speed this process up.

---
## 4.5 Storage on Land Surface
Water which does not infiltrate can be stored on the land surface in ponds. There can be several causes:
- The land surface is almost impermeable, because the surface is paved or impermeable bedrock occurs close to the surface
- The precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil. This is called **infiltration excess**
- The soil is already saturated and further storage of water is no longer possible. This is called **unsaturated excess**
- There is [[Seepage]]: groundwater flowing upwards to the surface

Ponding often takes place in low-lying parts of the landscape. This effect is called **Depression Storage**. It is common in areas with limited relief, but also occurs on a smaller scale in hilly areas.

Water can also be stored on the land surface as snow. 

Both depression storage and snow storage result in a delay in water flow towards the catchment outlet.

---
## 4.6 Surface Runoff
When ponding occurs on a sloping surface, [[Surface Runoff]] (also called overland flow) occurs. Surface runoff (not to be confused with [[Runoff]]), is water which flows over the land surface during and just after a rain shower. This water wil eventually end up in channels of the catchment.

The precipitation surplus will flow down over the steepest slope and will eventually reach the closest channel. This water routing is much faster than groundwater flow. Hence, surface runoff results in a fast increase of the river discharge during and just after a rain event, but the water levels als decrease quickly after the event. 

Surface runoff often occurs in hilly and mountainous areas, especially close to the river (where the soil is often wet, causing [[Saturation Excess Overland Flow]]) or due to high precipitation intensities (causing [[Infiltration Excess Overland Flow]]). In flat areas, ponds often remain on the land surface without running off overland. Nevertheless, surface runoff also occurs in the Netherlands. 

---
## 4.7 Interflow
In some situations, water infiltrated but cannot percolate to the groundwater because there is a layer with low [[Permeability]] (bedrock or compacted soil layer) close to the surface which limits water flow. The result is that the soil above this layer becomes saturated, even though it is not in contact with the groundwater. The water follows the slope of the semi-impermeable layer. This is called [[Interflow]] and only occurs during and just after a rain shower, because this small water layer empties quickly.

---
## 4.8 Drainage
At every point in a river bank, groundwater can flow towards the surface water (often not visible). This process is called [[Drainage]]. In many areas drainpipes (or drains) are installed in agricultural fields and residential areas to increase drainage speed and reduce the probability of inundation. 

>[!Note]
>A large amount of water can be stored in the ground. This slowly empties into the river by drainage and therefore regulates the discharge of the river, especially in dry periods, when the contribution from groundwater to the river discharge is large. If the groundwater table is lower (deeper) than the surface water level, infiltration of surface water takes place. Hence, groundwater has a significant impact on discharge behaviour in rivers and thus on the water cycle of catchments. 


---
## 4.9 Seepage
A situation in which water enters an area via deeper soil layers and subsequently moves upward through the soil surface is called upwards [[Seepage]]. Downward seepage, also called [[Infiltration]], is the opposite: water infiltrates into the soil and will be transported to another area via groundwater flow. Both terms are, however, related to the scale at which the process is examined. 

---
# 5. Storage
## 5.1 Introduction
During wet periods, water can be stored in a catchment, and during drier periods that water can be released to be used for Evapotranspiration or [[Discharge]]. Water can be stored in the ground, on the land surface, in channels and lakes or as snow or ice. If catchments would not be able to store water, precipitation would be discharged directly, leading to high flood peaks, and no water would be available for evapotranspiration afterwards. Therefore, water managers increase thew storage capacity by constructing wadis in urban areas and retention basins and floodplains along rivers.

---
## 5.2 Groundwater Storage
After a rainfall event the groundwater level or [[Groundwater Table]] rises, saturating part of the [[Unsaturated Zone]] and storing water in the soil. This process is called groundwater storage. 

The amount of water that can be stored in the groundwater and the resulting rise of the groundwater table after a shower depend on the soil type. In coarse sandy soils, the groundwater table rises less than in clayey soils. Hence, sandy soils can store more water. Clayey soils can store less groundwater, because unsaturated clayey soils normally contain more water in their pores than sandy soils. 

The [[Specific Storage]] ($S_w$ in mm) is the volume of water in the soil (m$^3$) per unit of area (m$^2$). Infiltrating rain water that percolates to the groundwater increases the specific storage and evaporation decreases the specific storage. The effect of this addition or removal of water on the groundwater level ($h$ in mm) is much larger. For example, 1mm of rainfall often causes groundwater rise in the order of 1 cm.

>>The groundwater level change should always be larger than the change in specific storage

Storage change in soils is only possible in the unsaturated zone. During wet periods, when the soil is at [[Field Capacity]] (the wetness of the upper soil layer when the soil had lost its surplus of water to the groundwater after a wet period), it is possible to determine the storativity. This is done by dividing the amount of precipitation by the resulting rise of the groundwater table. 

>[!Note]
>The storativity is not constant, but depends on the groundwater level and the past weather (whether the soil is drying or moistening)

## 5.3 Surface Water Storage
Surface waters (rivers, lakes, etc.) can also store water, which results in a more gradual discharge towards the catchment outlet: the discharge peak is lower and reaches the outlet later than when less storage is possible. Some examples of surface water systems which can store water:
- A river or brook, including the floodplains
- Natural lakes in a catchment
- Man-made lakes which are constructed for socio-economic purposes, such as recreation or peat extraction
- Retention basins which are designed to lower peak discharges or to store irrigation water during dry periods (Wadis)
- Reservoirs which are designed for hydro-power plants or, on a smaller scale, water mills

---
## 5.4 Snow Storage
A thick snow layer can contain much water. The density of fresh snow is about eight times smaller than that of water, so 1 m of snow corresponds to 12.5 cm of water. Older or wet snow can have a density close to 50% of the density of water. Equation 5.1 can be used to convert a change in the amount of water in a snow pack height (instead of groundwater level), using the snow density (instead of the storativity).

# 6. Discharge
## 6.1 Introduction
As a result of precipitation surplus, water flows through or over the ground to the channels that drain the catchment. This water is called [[Runoff]]. The channels will then transport the water out of the catchment as [[Streamflow]]. 

One of the most useful hydrological variables to describe this water flow out of the catchment is the [[Discharge]]: the volume of water which passes a cross-section of a river per unit of time. The term runoff, streamflow and discharge are often used interchangeable, but strictly speaking, runoff means the formation of surface water, while streamflow and discharge are the transport of water through a channel.

Discharge is closely related to the flow velocity and water level. Together they determine whether erosion and sedementation occur and which aquatic flora and fauna can survive in the river.

---
## 6.2 Open Water Flow

>[!Important]
>The amount of water a river or stream can carry depends on several factors:
>- The size and cross-section of the channel
>- The roughness caused by the channel bed, including vegetation and rocks
>- The slope of the water table

The [[Discharge]] ($Q$ in m$^3$s$^{-1}$) of the river is the volume of water that passes the cross-sectional area ($A$ in m$^2$) of the river in a certain time period. The discharge is high when the cross-sectional area is large and when the flow velocity ($v$ in m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$) is high: 

$$
Q=\bar{v} \cdot A \tag{6.1}
$$


>[!Note]
>The line above the $v$ indicates that this is the average flow velocity of the cross-sectional area. Averaging is necessary because the flow velocity of water is lower closer to the banks, where friction slows the water down.

When the water flow in an open channel does not change in time ([[Stationary Flow]] or Steady Flow) or in space ([[Uniform Flow]]), it is possible to calculate the average velocity with the empirical [[Chézy Equation]]: 

$$
\bar{v}=C\sqrt{S_0 \;R_h} \tag{6.2} 
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the Chézy Coefficient (m$^{1/2}$ s$^{-1}$)
- $R_h$ is the hydraulic radius (m)
- $S_0$ is the slope of the channel bed (dimensionless)

The **Chézy Coefficient** is a measure for the conductivity (the opposite of roughness) of the channel bed and banks. Roughness is caused by the sediment particles (larger particles cause more friction) on the bed, rocks, vegetation and bedforms such as underwater dunes. A high value for $C$ indicates that the river bottom and banks are smooth, which results in almost no slowing down for the flow velocity

>[!Info]
>Normally, values for the Chézy coefficient lie between 10 m$^{1/2}$ s$^{-1}$ (for small and rough channels) and 75 m$^{1/2}$ s$^{-1}$ (for large and smooth channels)

The Chézy coefficient cannot be measured, but is usually estimated from look-up tables (with large uncertainty) or computed when all other terms in equation 6.2 are measured

The slope is the decrease in the height of the channel bed per meter in the alongstream direction. For stationary uniform flow, this is the same as the slope of the [[Groundwater Table|Water Table]]. The unit of $S_0$ is m/m (so dimensionless). Since $S_0$ is so small, it is often given in percents or permille.

>[!Note]
>Note, however, that the Chézy equation requires the slope in a fraction, so 0.001 instead of 0.1%

The **hydraulic radius** ($R_h$) is the ratio between the cross-sectional area ($A$) and the **wetted perimeter** $P$ (in m): 

$$
R_h = \frac{A}{P} \tag{6.3} 
$$

The wetted perimeter is the part of the circumference of the cross-section which is in contact with the bed and banks. The water surface is not part of the wetted perimeter because the water does not encounter friction with the air.

Combining equations 6.1 and 6.2 gives: 

$$
Q=\bar{v} \;\cdot A=C \; A \sqrt{S_0 \; R_h} \tag{6.4} 
$$

The discharge is, as expected, high in rivers with smooth bottoms and banks, large cross-sectional areas, steep slopes and a large hydraulic radius

>[!Question]
>What is the discharge of a brook of 4 m in width and a depth of 50 cmn, with a slope of 0.2% and a Chézy coefficient of 8 m$^{1/2}$ s$^{-1}$?
>
>>[!Check]- Answer

>>Compute each of the terms in the Chézy equation
>>
>>The surface area of the cross-sectional area: $A= 4 \cdot 0.5 = 2$ m$^2$
>>
>>The wetted perimeter: $P=0.5 + 4 + 0.5 = 5$ m
>>
>>The hydraulic radius: $R = \frac{A}{P} - \frac{2}{5} = 0.4$ m
>>
>>The slope: $S_0 = \frac{0.2}{100} = 0.002$

>>The flow velocity: $v=C\sqrt{S_0 \cdot R_h} = 8 \sqrt{0.002 \cdot 0.04} = 0.23$ m s$^{-1}$
>>
>>The discharge: $Q=v\cdot A=0.23\cdot 2=0.46$ m$^{1/2}$ s$^{-1}$
>>

>[!Info]
>The amount of water a channel can transport is called the discharge capacity. This can be computed using Chézy's equation as well, using the total channel cross-section with maximum water depth.

## 6.3 Measurement Techniques (`Optional`)
The discharge of a river or brook can be estimated by measuring the flow velocity and multiplying it with the cross-sectional area (eq. 6.1). Flow velocity can be measured using a propeller current meter, which rotates faster in fast flowing water and the number of revolutions per second can be converted into a flow velocity. This has to be done at multiple locations in the cross-section to obtain the average flow velocity

In large rivers, flow velocities are often measured using the Acoustic Doppler Current Profile (ADCP) instead of the propeller. The device is attached to the river banks and emits sounds waves. These signals are reflected by sediment particles which are transported by the river. Returning signals have a slightly different frequency than when they were emitted. From this change in frequency, the velocity of the particles and thus of the water can be calculated. With the ADCP flow velocities and discharge can be measured continuously, while the propeller only measures at one moment.

Since ADCP's are expensive, it is much more common to measure the water level (continuously) instead and convert that to discharge. Water levels are measured in stilling wells, which are vertical tubes which are connected to the river via a small horizontal tube.. The water level in the stilling well will move upward or downward, following the river water level, while the effects of waves in the river which are formed by gusts or passing boats are filtered out. A floating device or a submerged pressure sensor measure the water level.

To convert water level to discharge, a relation called **rating curve**, **Q-h-relation** or **stage-discharge relation** is needed. This rating curve can be set up by measuring both low and high discharges (for example with the propeller method) together with the occurring water levels and fitting a curve through the data points.

When a weir or flume is present, the rating curve can be set up more accurately. A weir is a set of wooden planks or a metal plate over which the water is forced. A flume is a metal or concrete narrowing in the river with specific dimensions, through which the water flows. The relationship between water level and discharge for these weirs and flumes is known from literature or derived in a hydraulics laboratory

# 7. Hydrograph
## 7.1 Introduction
A [[Hydrograph]] is a discharge time series. It provides information about the 'behaviour' of the catchment: the timing and height of discharge peaks after precipitation events and the slow decrease of discharge in dry periods. Studying the hydrograph together with the precipitation time series provides information about how the catchment works and makes it possible to predict how the discharge regime will change when land use, climate or water management change. It is also possible to determine how often high or low flows occur and estimate the risk of floods as well as dry periods. Finally, hydrographs help to forecast water levels and discharges after extreme precipitation events

---
## 7.2 Discharge Dynamics

>[!Important]
>Catchments act as a buffer between precipitation and discharge: precipitation events usually last only a few hours, but the discharge dynamics (temporal variability of discharge) is more gradual because water is stored in the catchment and released slowly afterwards. 

The catchment delays and attenuates (dampens) the precipitation signal. The amount of delay and attenuation depends on catchment characteristics, the channel network, the precipitation event and catchment wetness

>[!Info]
>In warm and temperate climates, most rivers are rain-fed rivers, where the discharge responds to rainfall events and the discharge decreases in periods without rain. The Meuse is an example of a rain-fed river: the discharge of the Meuse at the end of summer is often only 10% of the discharge during the beginning of spring.
>
>When precipitation falls as snow, it is accumulated until temperatures are high to melt it. The resulting discharge peak does not responds to a precipitation event. Rivers that are fed by both snow and rain are called mixed rivers. In the Alps, the contributions of snowmelt and glaciermelt to spring and summer discharge cause a relatively constant discharge in the Rhine over the year. 

---
## 7.3 Baseflow

>[!Important]
>Hydrographs can be sepaarated into [[Baseflow]], which includes the slow processes, and [[Quickflow]], which includes fast processes

In humid and temperate regions, rivers usually have a certain amount of water flowing, even when it has not rained for a long time. This 'minimum' discharge is called the [[Baseflow]] and mainly originates from the groundwater in a catchment. The amount of baseflow mainly depends on the underlying soil. A thick [[Aquifer]] (a permeable soil layer that stores and transports water) can store much water during wet periods and releases it slowly afterwards,. resulting in a long-lasting baseflow

During wet conditions (seasons), when the groundwater levels are relatively high, the baseflow is higher than in dry periods. The slow decrease in baseflow during dry periods is called the [[Recession]]. In smaller catchments in (semi-)arid climates or with little groundwater storage, the baseflow can drop to zero and the river runs dry. This often happens to first-order streams. Streams which carry water year-round are called [[Perennial Streams]] or rivers and streams which run dry part of the year are [[Ephemeral Streams]].

---
## 7.4 Quickflow
During and shortly after a rainfall event water can reach the channels via short pathways, such as surface runoff and flow through macropores (e.g. drainpipes, cracks in clayey soils or animal burrows), and cause a quick rise in discharge and water level. This component of the hydrograph is called the [[Quickflow]] (also called direct runoff) and causes the peaks on top of the baseflow. Of course, part of the rainwater infiltrates and percolates to the groundwater, which results in a slightly higher discharge over a longer period (due to the higher baseflow). Quickflow to the channels is a much faster process than the water flow from groundwater to the channels, which has to follow a longer route with more resistance. Therefore, floods and inundations are often caused by quickflow.

Factors that increase the probability of quickflow and high discharge peaks are:
- **Steep Topography**: Water flows fast in channels and through hillslopes and ponding results in surface runoff. In flat areas, the water that does not infiltrate stays in ponds and infiltrates later. 
- **Low Infiltration Capacity**: Precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity, leading to infiltration excess overland flow
- **High Drainage Intensity**: The distance towards the surface water (through or over the soil) is small and hence the travel time is short
- **Hydrophobic Soil**: Water cannot infiltrate, leading to surface runoff
- **High Precipitation Intensity**: Infiltration capacity is exceeded, leading to infiltration excess overland flow. When the same amount of precipitation is spread over a longer period, the water can infiltrate and percolate to the groundwater
- **Uneven Precipitation Distribution**: When a large amount of precipitation falls on one location, the soil becomes saturated locally, leading to saturation excess overland flow. When the precipitation is more evenly distributed over the catchment, the soil will probably be able to store all the water. 
- **Wet Initial Conditions**: When groundwater level and soil moisture content are high (due to previous precipitation events or a wet climate), flow through drainpipes and macropores occurs, leading to high discharge peaks. Saturation excess overland flow can also occur and amplify this effect.
- **Rain on Snow**: When rain falls on a snow cover, the snow melts quickly. If the soil is frozen, water cannot infiltrate, leading to surface runoff

---
## 7.5 Concentration Time and Response Time
The network of channels in a catchment determines the total distance river water has to travel before it reaches the catchment outlet. It therefore influences the shape of the discharge hydrograph. In an elongated catchment, the discharge peaks will be more smooth than in a compact catchment, because the contribution of the quickflow is spread out more (assuming the precipitation is evenly distributed over the catchment area)

The temporal dynamics of these catchments can be quantified with 2 terms.

The [[Concentration Time]] ($t_c$) is the time it takes for surface water at the most upstream point to reach the catchment outlet.

The [[Response Time]] (also called **lag time**, $t_r$) is the time difference between a rainfall event and the resulting discharge peak. It is usually measured as the time difference between the center of mass of the rainfall event and the maximum discharge (or the center of mass of the discharge peak). Catchment response times depend on both the shape of the channel network and the runoff processes which take place in the catchment.

# 8. Water Balance
## 8.1 Introduction
The previous sections described various processes which occur in the field of catchment hydrology. This section quantifies the contributions of these processes to the [[Water Balance]] or **water budget**. The water balance provides information about the total amounts of water which move into or out of a catchment during a certain time.

Next to the [[Hydrograph]] (which gives information about the variation of discharge in time), the water balance is a powerful tool to get insight in the way an area interacts with its surroundings, which is important for many applications. For example, the water balance can be used to determine how much water is available for drinking water or irrigation. For nature areas, the water balance gives information about the reason why certain plants will grow in an area and why others will not. In modelling studies, the water balance is often used in setting up the model or testing the performance. For water quality, the water balance provides a basis to calculate the nutrient balance of nitrogen and phosphorus.

---
## 8.2 The Water Balance Equation
The water balance is an application of the law of mass conversion (the mass balance): 

$$
Q_{in} - Q_{out} = \Delta S \tag{8.1}
$$

The difference between the inflow $Q_{in}$ and outflow $Q_{out}$ is the stored volume of water $\Delta S$. If, during a certain period, more water entered the area than left, then at the end of the period there is more water stored in the area than at the start.

In a water balance, we sum all incoming fluxes $Q_{in}$ and subtract the sum of all outgoing fluxes $Q_{out}$. Together, these fluxes (in - out) have to equal the change in storage $\Delta S$. The terms that are part of a water balance differ per area. The most complete form of the water balance is: 

$$
P-ET \pm Q \pm U_s \pm U_t \pm X = \Delta S \tag{8.2}
$$

Where:
- $P$ is precipitation (rain, snow, dew)
- $ET$ is evapotranspiration (interception evaporation, soil evaporation and transpiration)
- $Q$ is inflow minus outflow of the surface waters
- $U_s$ is upward (positive) or downward (negative) seepage
- $U_t$ is lateral inflow (positive) or outflow (negative) of groundwater (this concerns horizontal groundwater flow, while seepage is vertical groundwater flow)
- $X$ is additional sources and sinks, such as groundwater extraction, irrigation with water from outside the balance area, effluent from wastewater treatment flowing into the river, or water being discharged via the sewage system outside of the balance area
- $\Delta S$ is the storage change (in groundwater, surface water, soil moisture or snow)

In many natural catchments seepage, lateral groundwater flow and surface water inflow are not present, which simplifies the equation to: 

$$
P-ET-Q = \Delta S \tag{8.3}
$$


>[!Note]
>The units of the water balance terms can very between applications, as long as they are the same for all terms. Often, the units are in the form of $L \, T^{-1}$ or $L^3 \, T^{-1}$ where L is an arbitrary length unit and T an arbitrary time unit. Water balances for catchments are usually expressed in mm y$^{-1}$ or mm d$^{-1}$, because these units allow comparison with other catchments of different sizes.

---
## 8.3 The Balance Area
The water balance is set up over a specific area, such as a catchment, polder, single field or lake. The boundaries of a balance area are chosen such that the inflow and outflow of these boundaries are known or relatively easy to determine. For catchments, the water divide is used as boundary, because there is no water transport across the water divide

---
## 8.4 The Balance Period
The water balance can be set up for every period of time. Whole years are often used as balance period. The average annual water balance (set up over several years) is useful for comparing catchments. Separate years can show a catchment's behaviour during wet and dry years. 

In most cases, the volume of water that enters an area is not equal to the volume of water that leaves the area during the balance period: water is stored or released from storage. Especially when the balance period is small (less than a year), the storage change can be an important part of the water balance. Because this total catchment storage is difficult to measure, the start and ends of a balance period are often selected such that we can assume the difference in storage between the start and end is relatively small. In the Netherlands, the hydrological year starts on April 1, when the soil is usually at field capacity. 

>[!Note]
>The Hydrological Years run differently in different countries

Often, not all terms of the water balance are known. In those cases, the balance period can be chosen such that information can be obtained about the terms that were not measured. One of the water balance terms (such as evapotranspiration or seepage) can then be estimated by closing the water balance. 

>[!Note]
>It is important to note that the water balance terms are never measured perfectly. When summed (as in the water balance), the terms in the left hand side of the equation do not equal the terms on the right side. Hence, when one of the terms is determined as a residual of the water balance, there will be no information left about the inaccuracy of the measurements.


---
## 8.5 Water Balance of a Lake
It is also important to calculate the water balance for a water body, such as a lake. Important balance terms for lakes are surface water inflow and outflow, precipitation and evapotranspiration. Lakes also store water when the water level is not the same at the end of the balance period as at the start.

When the amount of water which flows into the lake is equal to the outflow (so no storage change), the average residence time $T_T$ of a water drop in this lake is: 

$$
T_T = \frac{V}{Q_{in}} = \frac{V}{Q_{out}} \tag{8.1}
$$

Where
- $V$ is the lake volume (L$^3$)
- $Q_{in}$ the sum of all incoming fluxes
- $Q_{out}$ the sum of all outgoing fluxes (similar to previously)

>[!Note]
>Note that in this equation $Q_{\text{in}}$ and $Q_{\text{out}}$ are not the same as $Q$ which is used for discharge only. We can express these terms in various units of time, such as seconds, days or years.
