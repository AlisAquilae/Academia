# 9. Groundwater Usage
## 9.1 Introduction
Groundwater is less visible than surface water, but plays a large role in natural processes and supplying water for society. This chapter gives examples of the usage of groundwater for drinking water and industry, the relation between groundwater depth and agricultural or natural vegetation and the effect of groundwater flow on the spread of pollutants. The importance of groundwater for Dutch spatial planning is further demonstrated. 

---
## 9.2 Water Supply
### 9.2.1 Drinking Water
In many places in the world, water is extracted from the soil to be used as drinking water. The quality of this water is often good, but there are exceptions

The amount of 5 L/d is defined as the minimum amount of water people need according to the World Health Organization. Without drinking water, a human being survives only a couple of days.

Only 1.5% of tap water is used for human consumption in the Netherlands (drinks and food). More water is used for showering and bathing (38%), flushing the toilet (29%), cleaning the dishes (6%), and irrigating gardens or washing cars (8%). 

To assess the impact of groundwater extraction in terms of water availability, the extraction can be compared to the other water balance terms. The water used for the whole population of the Netherlands is about $838 \cdot 10^6$ m$^3$. The biggest share ($544 \cdot 10^6$ m$^3$) of this amount is extracted from groundwater. When this is compared to the precipitation - evaporation for the area of the Netherlands, it becomes clear that about 6% of the precipitation surplus is used for drinking water.

>[!Question]
>Consider 2 areas with groundwater extraction. Area A is 5000 km$^2$ large, has a precipitation surplus of 350 mm/y, and 175 million m$^3$ groundwater is extracted. Area B is 2000 km$^2$ large, has a precipitation surplus of 200 mm/y, and 500 million m$^3$ groundwater is extracted. Which fraction (%) of the precipitation surplus is extracted in these areas?
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>A: 10%
>>
>>B: 125% In this area, more water is extracted than groundwater recharge, meaning that groundwater levels will go down
>>

>[!Note]
>The computation above spreads the water use over the whole land surface, but groundwater cannot be extracted everywhere, so a larger part of the precipitation surplus is extracted from some locations. Sometimes, surface water is led to the extraction sites to infiltrate and compensate for the extracted water. Due to the elevation differences, surface water supply is not economically feasible for the main Dutch drinking water extraction sites, which are located on the elevated sandy soils in the East and South

### 9.2.2 Industry
Drinking water companies also deliver groundwater to industries, companies and other destinations such as the fire brigade and recreational areas. The industry itself also extracts groundwater for cleaning, cooling or for their industrial processes. Together, industry uses 535 million m$^3$/y, a similar amount as extracted by drinking water companies. Domestic and industrial water use together leads to an average annual water use of 30 mm/y. This is quite a large amount, which has led to **desiccation** (the process of becoming too dry) of some areas. 

In addition to the amount of available water, the water quality of groundwater determines whether extraction is possible. During the last century, the quality of the drinking water deteriorated in some areas. As a result of excessive fertiliser and pesticide applications in intensive agriculture, nitrate and pesticides leached to the groundwater and the polluted water had to be purified before it could be used. 

### 9.2.3 Agriculture
Crops transpire huge amounts of water via their open stomata. In the Netherlands, about 6500 L/p/d are used for food production, which is much more than the 135 L/d for domestic use. Plants extract water from the topsoil, where their roots are situated, leading to lower soil moisture contents in the root zone. This can be replenished by precipitation or capillary rise from the groundwater. 

In the Netherlands, there is a precipitation surplus in winter and a precipitation deficit in summer. Therefore, water stored in the root zone in the winter season is another important source of water during crop growth in the summer season. The same is the case in areas with a distinct wet and dry season, for example caused by the monsoon. 

>[!Note]
>The [[Capillary Rise]] may form a valuable water source for vegetation in drought periods. However, the spatial variation in capillary rise is large. This water flux depends on the distance between the groundwater table and the root zone. When the groundwater is deep, capillary rise cannot occur because a too large suction would be needed to move the water far upwards, against gravity. In coarse material, the water film around the soil particles in the unsaturated zone is thin and discontinuous, which makes water movement more difficult as well. 
>
>Very shallow groundwater tables, on the other hand, can also cause problems. Plant roots need air (oxygen) and therefore a very shallow groundwater table can also lead to yield reductions. In addition, when groundwater is shallow, clayey, loamy and peaty soils become soft and cattle and cultivation vehicles may compact or damage the topsoil. The optimal water level differs per crop and soil type. Hence, water managers put much effort into maintaining optimal groundwater levels by making use of drainpipes, ditches and channels. This infrastructure is designed based on the past climate, but may have to be altered to cope with the future climate change. 

>[!Info]
>In semi-arid areas, most or all water for crop production comes from irrigation. Next to the water availability, the salt concentration of the water can become problematic. Long-term irrigation brings large amounts of dissolved salts to irrigated soils. In addition, the capillary rise may transport salt from the groundwater to the root zone, where it will accumulate. High salinity concentrations in the root zone make it hard for plants to extract enough water from the soil to meet their transpiration demand. Therefore, in semi-arid areas extra irrigation water should be applied to leach the soil and groundwater levels should be well-controlled to prevent waterlogging and salinisation by capillary rise. 


---
## 9.3 Groundwater and Nature
Natural vegetation also depends on groundwater, because it requires enough water for transpiration, while at the same time enough air should be available for the roots. Some plant types need very wet environments and can transport air within their stems and roots. These wet vegetation types often require stable and shallow groundwater tables because groundwater tables affect the main physical, chemical and biological processes in the soil. 

>[!Example]
>An example is the degradation of organic matter, which determines the amount of available nutrients. Nutrient status is one of the most important factors in plant competition.

The chemical composition of groundwater has a large effect on vegetation type. Rainwater has a different composition than seepage water (groundwater flowing upwards and out of the ground in valleys) which has been in the soil for centuries or even thousands of years. Some plants require water with the chemical composition of rainwater, while others require water with the chemical composition of seepage water. 

>[!Important]
>
>In summary, vegetation requires a combination of location factors that belong to their species. They could require fresh or salty water, wet or dry conditions, nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor conditions, etc. The local groundwater flow conditions determine all of these factors to a large extent. In cases where humans have influenced the regional water management, for example to recover or protect so-called blue grassland vegetation, proper analysis of groundwater flow determines the succes or failure of these measures.

## 9.4 Groundwater and Pollution (`Optional`)
Groundwater can be polluted with different compounds and from different sources. In most areas, agriculture is the largest source of contamination. High amounts of nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) and pesticides leak from agricultural fields to the groundwater (and the surface water). The industry discharges polluted water or gases with heavy metals, solvents and many other organic micropollutants. Besides that, hormones and other particles reach the soil and groundwater. Since groundwater flows very slowly, pollution can stay in the ground for decades or centuries and historical pollution can cause problems for future generations. 

In order to secure public health, agriculture and the environment, universities, institutes, consultancy firms and governmental agencies ask the following essential questions:
- Do pollutants reach the groundwater, or are they stored or broken down in the unsaturated zone?
- When these pollutants reach the groundwater, in which direction will they move?
- How fast do the pollutants move in the groundwater?
- What is the effect of these pollutants on drinking water or industrial water extracted from groundwater, on residential areas or on surface water quality?

# 10. Layers and Soil Properties
## 10.1 Introduction
The subsurface consists of layers of geological deposits, which can either be loose soil material such as sand, clay and gravel ([[Unconsolidated Sediment]]) or bedrock ([[Consolidated Sediment]]). In delta areas, the bedrock can be hundreds of meters deep and does not affect groundwater flow, while in mountainous areas it can be at the land surface. This chapter contains many examples from delta areas with unconsolidated sediment, but groundwater flow through consolidated sediment can be measured, analysed and computed in the same way. 

Water flow through the soil depends on the properties of these geological deposits, in particular the thickness of the layers and the soil type.

---
## 10.2 Soil Properties: Conductivity and Porosity
From a hydrological point of view, soil material can be characterised using 2 properties: the conductivity and the porosity

The [[Permeability|Conductivity]] (also called [[Permeability]], $k$ in m/d) is a measure of how easily water can flow through the soil material. The conductivity is used to compute groundwater flow.

Water flows less easily through unsaturated soil, as water can only flow through the water film attached to the soil particles. The maximum conductivity is reached when the soil is saturated: the [[Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity]]. Since this chapter concerns groundwater (i.e. saturated conditions), we always mean saturated hydraulic conductivity when we use the term conductivity.

Some soils have a layered structure, for example when loose material is compacted, when thin layers of clay are deposited in sand or when the clay is fractured. In that case, the conductivity is higher in one direction than the other and is called [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]]. The opposite, [[Isotropy|isotropic]], means that the conductivity is the same in all directions. Anisotropy is common in consolidated sediments, where fractures in the bedrock have a large impact on the flow direction. 

The [[Porosity]] ($n$ in %) is the fraction of the soil volume that is not taken up by soil particles. 

>[!Note]
>In saturated soils, this gives the water fraction in the soil. 

>[!Info]
>Typical values of conductivity and porosity of some soil types
>
| Soil material | Subtype | Conductivity $k$ (m/d) | Porosity $n$ (%) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Gravel |  | > 250 | 25 - 40 |
| Sand | Coarse | 5 - 100 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Fine | 1 - 5 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Very fine | 0.2 - 0.5 | 30 - 50 |
| Clay | With large fractures | 10 - 100 | 45 - 70 |
|  | Some macropores or fractures | 0.5 - 2 | 35 - 60 |
|  | No macropores or fractures | < 0.005 | 35 - 60 |
| Peat | Above groundwater table | 0.1 - 5 | 60 - 85 |
|  | Below groundwater table | 0.0001 - 0.5 | 50 - 80 |


Some of the water is attached to soil particles and does not move. The [[Effective Porosity]] ($n_e$ in %) is the fraction of the soil volume that is filled with water that can move, and is used to compute flow velocities and residence times. The effective porosity is always somewhat smaller than the total porosity.

Mineral soils with large grains (gravel and course sand) have a higher conductivity than soil types with small particles (clay). Large particles cannot be packed firmly together, which leads to large pore spaces. Water can then move easily from one pore to the next because the 'channels' between the particles are wider, resulting in a higher flow velocity. The porosity is higher for clay than gravel, since small particles take up less space. However, the range of porosities found for certain soil types overlap with each other, while the conductivities of different soil types vary by several orders of magnitude.

Organic soils (peat) consist of partly decomposed plant material, which contains much water (very high porosity), but this water is fixed in stems and leaves, leading to a very low conductivity. 

>[!Note]
>Even within one soil type, there can be large differences: for clays the presence of fractures is very important, while for sands the grain size is important. For peat soils, the degree of aeration (degree to which peat is exposed to air during part of the year) determines the saturated conductivity

---
## 10.3 Layer Properties: Conductance and Resistance
Soil particles have been deposited in layers, in different time periods and under different conditions. These layers are often horizontal (although they can tilt) and have a certain **layer thickness** ($D$, in m)

The [[Permeability|Conductivity]] $k$ and layer thickness $D$ together determine the capacity of a layer to transport water horizontally or to limit water flow vertically. 

The horizontal transportation capacity is expressed by the [[Conductance]] or Transmissivity ($kD$, in m$^2$ / d). It is simply the product of $k$ and $D$: 

$$
kD = k \cdot D \tag{10.1}
$$

This equation shows that a large volume of water can flow horizontally through a thick layer of permeable material. 

>[!Info]
>A conductance below 250 m$^2$ / d is considered very low, 750 m$^2$ / d is moderately high and above 2000 m$^2$ / d is very high

The capacity to flow vertically is expressed by the [[Resistance]] ($c$ in days): 

$$
c=\frac{D}{k} \tag{10.2}
$$

This equation shows that a thick layer of poorly permeable material hampers flow.

>[!Question]
>Q: Compute the conductance and resistance of a deposit of 20 m fine sand

>>
>>The conductivity $k$ of fine sand is about 3 m/d
>>
>>Conductance $kD=3\cdot20=60$ m$^2$ / d
>>
>>Resistance $c=\frac{20}{3}\approx 7$ d

---
## 10.4 Geologic Layers
A layer that consists of permeable material (i.e. with high conductivity, for example gravel or sand) is called an [[Aquifer]] or permeable layer. Aquifers can transport water easily and are characterised by their conductance ($kD$). An [[Aquitard]], confining unit or poorly permeable layer is a bad transporter of water and often consists of clays or soil with much organic material. Their ability to seal off aquifers is measured in terms of resistance. An [[Aquiclude]] is a layer for which the resistance is so high that no water flows through at all

Sometimes an aquifer varies in size. This is the case when the aquifer contains the groundwater table. Since the groundwater level varies, thee thickness of the layer through which groundwater flows changes as well, and thereby its conductance. Such an aquifer is called a [[Phreatic Aquifer]]. 

When an aquifer is enclosed by an aquitard above and below, this aquifer is known as a [[Confined Aquifer]]. By definition, this layer is always completely saturated. 

Groundwater does not flow until the center of the Earth. There is a certain lower boundary beneath which water does not take part in the hydrological cycle anymore. This is called the [[Hydrological Base]].

>[!Question]
>Which Aquitard has a higher resistance: a 5 m thick layer of clay without fractures or a 20 mm thick layer of clay with some fractures?
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>The conductivity $k$ of clay without fractures is at most 0.005 m/d and for clay with some fractures $k$ is at least 0.5 m/d.

>>For the clay layer without fractures: 
>>
>>$$
>>c=\frac{D}{k}=\frac{5}{0.005}=1000 \text{d}
>>$$
>>
>>For the clay layer with fractures: 
>>
>>$$
>>c=\frac{D}{k}=\frac{20}{0.5}=40 \text{d}
>>$$
>>
>>Since 1000 > 40, the (thinner) clay layer without fractures has a higher resistance

---
## 10.5 Combining Layers
When two or more aquifers are positioned on top of each other, the Effective Conductivity of the combination can be computed. This is a weighted average of the conductivities of the separate layers. The combined conductance (for aquifers) is the sum of the conductances of the separate layers - the total conductance becomes larger since the flowing water can be divided over multiple layers. The combined resistance for aquitards is the sum of the resistances of the separate layers - the total resistance becomes larger since the water flow is first hampered by passing the first layer, then the second, etc.

>[!Question]
>An Aquifer consists of 3 deposits: 10 m of gravel ($k=230$ m/d) on top of 2 m of fine sand ($k = 8$ m/d) on top of 20 m of coarse sand ($k=85$ m/d). What are the effective conductivity and total conductance of this combined layer?

>>The total conductance is the sum of the $kD$'s of the layers:

# 11. Groundwater Level
## 11.1 Introduction
Water in the soil is located in pores between solid particles of sand, clay, peat, and organic carbon. If you dig a deep hole, it will mostly fill itself with water. The border between water and air in the hole is called the [[Groundwater Table]] or the Phreatic Plane. The elevation of the groundwater table is usually measured as groundwater level with respect to mean sea level (abbreviated as a.m.s.l) or groundwater depth with respect to land surface. Using the land surface is only possible for local studies since the land elevation varies in space. 

---
## 11.2 Groundwater and Soil Moisture
Water below the Groundwater Table is called [[Groundwater]] and above the groundwater table is called [[Soil Moisture]]

>[!Info]
>Groundwater has a positive pressure (compared to the atmospheric pressure), while soil moisture has a negative pressure. Even though the pressure is lower than the atmosphere, the zone above the groundwater table still contains water as a result of adhesive and cohesive forces which make water 'stick' to the soil particles.

Just above the groundwater table, there is a thin zone (0-30 cm) where the pressure is just below atmospheric pressure and all pores are filled with water: the [[Capillary Fringe]]. The capillary fringe is part of the saturated zone, but not part of the groundwater since the water particles are sticking to the soil particles rather than sitting on top of the water below (and exerting pressure on it). The water in the capillary fringe is therefore technically soil moisture and not groundwater. Since the capillary fringe is only a thin layer, it is often neglected in practical applications and the saturated zone is considered equal to the groundwater zone.

>[!Info]
>Groundwater levels can be measured in a Piezometer (also called groundwater well or groundwater tube). A piezometer is a pvc or metal tube with a cross-section of 5-10 centimeters. It is perforated over a length of about 1 m at the bottom end and the holes are covered with a gauze to prevent soil particles from flowing into the tube. The perforated part is called the filter. A hole is drilled in the ground and the piezometer is installed deep enough that the filter is always below the groundwater table. If the perforated part is below the groundwater table, the piezometer will fill with water and the water inside the tube will rise to the groundwater level. This process will take some time because the water in the soil moves slowly. 
>
>The groundwater depth can be measured manually with a special type of measuring tape, which is lowered into the tube and makes a sound when the tip touches the water surface. Usually, the level is measured compared to the top of the tube and converted to a level about mean sea level, using the elevation of the tube. 

---
## 11.3 Heads
Groundwater droplets experience forces that may push them in a certain direction. The forces originate from differences in energy between different locations. In hydrology and hydraulics, these energies are usually measured as the length of a water column that would lead to the same [[Potentiële Energie|Potential Energy]]. The total energy of a droplet is called the **Potential** and the corresponding water column height is called the [[Hydraulic Head]] ($H$ in m). The hydraulic head consists of 2 components: the [[Elevation Head]] ($z$ in m) and the [[Pressure Head]] ($h$ in m): 

$$
H=z+h \tag{11.1} 
$$

The elevation head is simply the elevation of the water droplet compared to a certain reference level (e.g. sea level). 

The pressure head is the local pressure as it would be measured using a pressure meter (converted to a water column length). This pressure is mostly caused by the pressure of the groundwater above it, but it is often increased (when groundwater is pushed to the location of interest from somewhere else) or decreased (when groundwater is led away from the location). 

As mentioned earlier, groundwater droplets always experience a positive pressure compared to atmospheric pressure. In hydrology, atmospheric pressure is used as a reference for the pressure head (zero pressure). Hence, the pressure equals zero at all places that are accessible to the atmosphere (for example at the groundwater table). Although atmospheric pressure varies in space and time, it may be considered constant for groundwater applications, which concern slow (years to centuries) and regional (10-50 km) processes.

![[Pasted image 20240220230018.jpg]]

The figure above displays the elevation head, pressure head and hydraulic head measured in a [[Phreatic Aquifer]]. The measurements of the piezometer hold for the soil volume directly around the filter since that is where the tube is in connection with the groundwater. The hydraulic head $H$ is constant within the piezometer. This means that the hydraulic head $H$ at the water table is the same as the hydraulic head at the filter. At the groundwater table, $h=0$, so $H=z$ so the hydraulic head in a piezometer is equal to the water level in the piezometer. Note that further down in the piezometer, the elevation head is smaller but the pressure head is higher (a larger water column sitting on the droplet), leading to the same hydraulic head.

>[!Note]
>
>The hydraulic head can be measured in the same way in confined aquifers and aquitards. However, the water level in the piezometer may not correspond to the groundwater level, because the groundwater level belongs to another hydrogeologic layer. 

---
## 11.4 Flow Direction
Differences in hydraulic heads cause groundwater flow. This is illustrated for two reservoirs with different water levels.

![[Pasted image 20240222214335.jpg]]

Water flows from the reservoir with the highest water level (and therefore the highest hydraulic head $H$) to the reservoir with the lowest water level. As the water level difference becomes smaller, the flow velocity will decrease. The same happens with groundwater flow. Water flows from the ground towards a river when the groundwater level is higher than the river water level ($H$ is higher in the ground). The groundwater will flow towards and into the river, so the groundwater level will slowly drop unless this water is compensated by water percolating from the soil surface (originating from precipitation. During prolonged dry periods, the groundwater levels (and $H$) will keep decreasing, and the flow towards the river will decrease or even reverse. 

![[Pasted image 20240222214515.jpg]]

>[!Question]
>2 piezometers are placed with their filters in 2 aquifers divided by an aquitard. The filter of the piezometer in the top aquifer is located at 3 m a.m.s.l and the water level in the tube is at 4 m a.m.s.l.. The filter of the piezometer in the bottom aquifer is located at 3 m below a.m.s.l. and the water level in the tube is at 5 m a.m.s.l.. Give the flow direction (upward or downward) and compute the pressure head at both aquifers
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>The hydraulic head at the filter in the bottom aquifer is higher (5m) than in the top aquifer (4m), indicating upward flow (seepage)

>>
>>For the top piezometer: $h=4-3=1$ m. For the bottom piezometer: $h=5 --3 = 8$ m.

>>Hence, the pressure in the aquifer near the filter of the bottom piezometer is higher, which is both caused by the pressure of the water column on top and by the pressure resulting from the seepage flux.

# 12 Isohypses & Equipotential Lines
## 12.1 Introduction
The [[Hydraulic Head]] is the most important variable in hydrogeology as it determines the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow. Spatial variations in hydraulic head are visualised with [[Equipotential Lines]], which connect points with equal hydraulic head (and therefore equal potential). Equipotential lines are used both on maps (top view) and vertical cross-sections

For [[Phreatic Aquifer|Phreatic Aquifers]], lines connecting points with equal groundwater levels (called [[Isohypses]]) can be drawn on maps. Since the hydraulic head corresponds to the groundwater level in phreatic aquifers, isohypses are a type of equipotential lines and we use the terms interchangeably. Maps with isohypses immediately show the flow direction, which can be used to determine which area drains towards a certain river or in which direction potential pollutants will move.

---
## 12.2 Flow Lines and Flow Nets
Water flows from high to low hydraulic heads. The paths water droplets take can be visualised with **flow lines**. If the soil is [[Isotropy|Isotropic]] (i.e. [[Permeability|Conductivity]] is the same in all directions), the flow lines are perpendicular to the equipotential lines, because the water droplets follow the steepest decrease in hydraulic head (steepest slope of the groundwater table). When a soil is [[Anisotropy|Anisotropic]], water will not follow the steepest slope, but it will follow the route of lowest [[Resistance]]. In that case, the angle between equipotential lines and flow lines will deviate from 90 degrees. A **flow path** or **flow tube** is the area between two flow lines. A **flow net** is a network of equipotential lines and flow lines.

![[Pasted image 20240222215543.jpg]]

The first figure displays an aquifer that is enclosed at the top and bottom by two almost impermeable layers. Due to the difference in water level between the channels, water will flow from the left to the right channel through the aquifer. Since there is no vertical flux through the impermeable layer (no water entering or exiting the aquifer from above or below), the horizontal water flux is constant. The equipotential lines of this situation are displayed in the second figure, which is an example of a flow net. Since the soil is isotropic, the flow lines (dashed lines) are perpendicular to the equipotential lines. 

---
## 12.3 Curvilinear Square Flow Nets
When setting up a flow net, a hydrologist can choose at which intervals to draw equipotential lines and flow lines. A smart way to do this is by constructing a Curvilinear Sqare Flow Net.

![[Pasted image 20240222215834.jpg]]

This figure shows a part of a curvilinear square flow net. The displayed equipotential lines are a result of hydraulic head measurements at many locations. First, the equipotential lines are drawn at a constant distance ($\Delta x$). The values of the equipotential lines (the hydraulics heads $H_1$, $H_2$ and $H_3$) often decrease with fixed steps, but this is not necessary. Next, flow lines are drawn perpendicular to the equipotential lines (isotropic soil). The starting points are chosen in such a way that the distance between the flow lines ($\Delta y$) equals the distance between equipotential lines ($\Delta x$). If this is done for all flow lines, a curvilinear square flow net is formed. 

>[!Note]
>The advantage of curvilinear square flow nets is that the volume of water flowing through each flow tube (in m$^3$/d) is the same


---
## 12.4 Dupuit's Assumption
Flow lines also reveal the flow direction in hydrogeological layers. 

![[Pasted image 20240222215951.jpg]]

This figure shows a schematised flow pattern through a valley between 2 ice-pushed ridges. Water infiltrates on both ice-pushed ridges, and in the valley both upward and downward seepage occur. These processes vary in space and time. The spatial variability is a result of differences in elevation and soil composition, while the temporal variability is a result of wet and dry periods. During wet periods, mainly infiltration and percolation occur, while during dry periods upward seepage is the dominant process. 

In the figure, 3 aquifers and 2 aquitards are visible. The bottom of the third aquifer is at approximately 100 m below sea level. Water flows mainly horizontally through aquifers and mainly vertically through aquitards. Often, especially for projects at regional scale, the groundwater flow is mainly horizontal. The reason is that the horizontal distances are much larger than the vertical distances. Even though the water fluxes are smaller, vertical water flow is important, especially for local scale and for areas with upward seepage that have vegetation depending on the chemistry of this seepage water.

In 1863, Dupuit made the assumption that for most circumstances the error in the estimation of groundwater flow will be relatively small when the vertical stream component is neglected. Forchheimer continued with his ideas in 1914, which resulted in the so-called [[Dupuit Assumptions]], which state that the flow in aquifers can be simplified to horizontal flow and flow through aquitards can be simplified to vertical flow. These assumptions make analyses of three-dimensional groundwater systems much easier. 

![[Pasted image 20240222220259.jpg]]

This figure at A displays a fictional groundwater flow pattern. Suppose that the soil of every layer is isotropic, so flow lines are perpendicular to the equipotential lines. If we apply the Dupuit assumptions, the flow pattern will change to B

The aquifers only have horizontal water flow and hydraulic head gradients (so vertical equipotential lines); the aquitards only have vertical water flow and hydraulic head gradients (horizontal equipotential lines - not shown)

For the phreatic aquifer, the consequence of the Dupuit assumptions is that each point in a vertical cross-section through the aquifer has the same hydraulic head, which equals the groundwater level there. From groundwater level measurements at several locations, an isohypse map can be constructed and the direction of the horizontal flow in this aquifer (perpendicular to the isohypses) can be found. In addition, the slope of the groundwater table can be used to calculate the flow magnitude.

Vertical flow directions (infiltration or seepage) can be determined by making hydraulic head maps for both aquifers. For each location on the map, the hydraulic head in the top and bottom aquifers are compared. When $H$ is higher in the top aquifer than in the bottom aquifer, infiltration occurs. In this way, spatial patterns of infiltration and seepage can be found.

# 13. Flow Patterns
## 13.1 Introduction
The land surface can be divided into **recharge areas**, where water flows into the ground, and **seepage areas**, where water is exiting the ground. Water can also leave the soil by flowing into channels or drainpipes, through which the water is discharged. The flow towards these drainage systems can follow a fast and short route when the water has infiltrated nearby, or a long route which takes centuries. Maps of [[Equipotential Lines]] and [[Isohypses]] are used to determine which path the water takes. 

>[!Important]
>
>Since flow is caused by [[Hydraulic Head]] differences, flow velocities are high when the change in hydraulic head is large over a short distance, which is visible by short distances between equipotential lines or isohypses.

---
### 13.2 Recharge and Seepage Areas

![[Pasted image 20240222220655.jpg]]

The figure above shows how water flows from a recharge area to a seepage area. The left and right edges of the figure are the water divides: here the groundwater tables are horizontal, so the hydraulic head is the same in the horizontal direction and there is no horizontal flow. In between, the groundwater table slopes, so water flows form right to left. In the recharge area, the volume of water that has to be transported through a vertical cross-section increases when moving away from the water divide (because more water has infiltrated between the water divide and the point of interest). The consequence is that the hydraulic head (and thus the groundwater level) decreases more quickly (the slope of the groundwater table becomes steeper), so water flows faster and a larger volume of water can be transported in the same amount of time. 

>[!Important]
>
>Therefore, the slope of the groundwater table is steepest in the middle of the figure, at the transition from the infiltration to seepage area. 

In the seepage area, water is leaving the ground, so less water needs to be transported through the soil when moving from the middle of the figure to the left edge. Therefore, the slope of the water table gradually decreases from the start of  the seepage area towards the left. 

>[!Note]
>That is why isohypse maps give a good first impression of recharge and seepage areas, which is very relevant to the environmental conditions and vegetation. 

The same can be seen in the following picture, which gives a top view of the isohypse pattern of a homogeneous and isotropic phreatic aquifer below a hill

![[Pasted image 20240222220807.jpg]]

Groundwater recharge takes place by surplus rainfall (= rainfall - evapotranspiration). Between the water divide and the 19 m-isohypse, the isohypses get closer together, which indicates infiltration (a groundwater recharge area), since a steeper slope of the hydraulic head is needed to transport more water. Between the 19 m- and 17 m-isohypses, the isohypses get further apart, which indicates a seepage area.

>[!Summary]
>
>When looking at a top view map with isohypses, areas where isohypses get close together hint at an infiltration area, whereas isohypses which move further apart points to a seepage area

## 13.3 Flow to a Drainpipe

![[Pasted image 20240222220926.jpg]]

The figure above displays a net of stationary flow (flow constant in time) to a drainpipe. A drainpipe is a horizontal porous tube which transports soil water rapidly to the surface water system. 

>[!Info]
>Drainpipes are not only common in delta areas but also in semi-arid regions with irrigation, since surplus water that is needed to prevent salinisation should be drained. Otherwise waterlogging could occur.

The image displays a winter situation with barely any evapotranspiration and a groundwater recharge of 7 mm/d. The left and right side of the figure are symmetry axes through which no water flows (note the horizontal water table). The left side is the middle of the drain and the right side is the water divide (the middle of the field between the drains). Precipitation which falls on the water divide (10 m from the drain) flows downward, then to the left and finally it flows vertically upward as seepage just below the drain. 

Closer to the drain, the slope of the groundwater table becomes steeper. The explanation is the same as previously: the amount of groundwater flow increases with distance from the water divide, because the accumulated recharge is larger. Therefore, the hydraulic head needs to decrease more quickly. As at the groundwater table the the hydraulic head equals the groundwater level, the slope of the groundwater table becomes steeper near the drain. 

The equipotential lines show similar behaviour as the groundwater table: they are closer together near the drain because their gradient is the force behind water flow. However, where an isohypse map only reveals horizontal flow, equipotential lines can also indicate upward water flow to the drains.

## 13.4 Nested Flow Nets
Knowing the flow direction around drainpipes is useful for field scale applications, but these flows are of minor importance for regional studies (more than tens of km). In a vertical cross-section of a large ares (with flow lines) short and long routes can be distinguished. A landscape often has multiple nested groundwater networks, which means that small networks are part of a bigger network.

>[!Example]
>For example, in the Netherlands, water flows roughly from the southeast to the northwest (from high to low). Within the elevated areas in the south and the east, however, there is often a pattern of infiltration areas on sandy soils together with seepage areas in the brook valleys. The brook valleys sometimes have ditches and drainpipes, which drain water that has infiltrated nearby

>[!Info]
>The division into local and regional systems is important because these differences in spatial scales result in differences in temporal scales. In general longer flow routes take more time. The movement of water between 2 ditches never takes more time than some years, while water that is extracted from the border of the Veluwe has infiltrated at the beginning of the Holocene (11,000 years ago). Due to the long residence time, pathogens do not survive and the water quality of this well is excellent. These temporal scales also determine the variability of the stream pattern over time. The flow to ditches changes between years and seasons, while regional flow patterns remain the same for decades or centuries.

## 13.5 Interpreting Isohypse Maps

![[Pasted image 20240222221025.jpg]]

The figure above displays an isohypse map of a brook that flows into a river. From the 13-m-isohypse to the 7-m-isohypse, the distance between the isohypses becomes smaller, indicating an infiltration area. From the 7-m-isohypse to the 4-m-isohypse, the distance between the isohypses becomes larger, indicating a seepage area. 

These maps usually do not contain flow lines, but they can be drawn perpendicular to the isohypses and reveal the following details:
- First, the river flows towards the west since the lower hydraulic head decreases in that direction. 
- At point A, groundwater flows towards the brook. 
- At point B, something strange happens: the isohypses are close together, indicating a steep groundwater drop. The 9-m-isohypse indicates flow from the brook to the groundwater, while the 8-m-isohypse indicates flow from the groundwater to the brook. Probably there is a weir here, which results in relatively high surface water levels upstream of the weir, while there will be relatively low surface water levels downstream of the weir. The drop in groundwater level is more gradual than the drop in surface water, but causes groundwater flow around the weir. Groundwater tends to bypass weirs and dams! 
- At point C the isohypses are circular. The values of the isohypses show that the water flows to point C from all directions and then disappears. The only explanation is that at point C groundwater is extracted from the soil.

# 14. Flow Magnitude
## 14.1 Introduction
When the difference in [[Hydraulic Head]] and the material and size of soil layers are known, the amount of water flow can be computed using [[Darcy's Law]]: the most important equation for groundwater hydrology. Darcy's Law can be used to calculate the amount of water flow through soil, both in the horizontal and vertical direction and through both [[Aquifer|Aquifers]] and [[Aquitard|Aquitards]].

## 14.2 Darcy's Law for Horizontal Flow

![[Pasted image 20240222221229.jpg]]

The figure above shows a confined aquifer with 4 piezometers. The [[Hydraulic Head]] is higher (longer water column) in the 2 piezometers at the back ($H_2$) than in the 2 piezometers at the front ($H_1$), so water will flow from the back to the front. There is no difference between the front left and front right piezometer (and between the back left and back right ones), so no water will flow from left to right or from right to left. 

The volume of water flowing out of the aquifer at the front in a certain amount of time is the [[Discharge]] (also called Groundwater Discharge, $Q$ in m$^3$/d). The discharge is used to determine how many m$^3$ are transported through an aquifer, for example to determine if there is enough water available for groundwater extraction.

The discharge is computed as 

$$
Q=kDB \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x} \tag{14.1} 
$$

Where
- $k$ is the [[Permeability|Conductivity]]
- $D$ is soil layer depth
- $B$ is soil layer width
- $H$ is the [[Hydraulic Head]]
- $x$ is the distance in the flow direction

The formula reads as follows. If the conductivity ($k$) is high, water can flow through the ground easily, leading to a higher discharge. A thicker aquifer ($D$)  or wider strip of land considered ($B$, perpendicular to the flow direction) leads to a larger cross-section through which water can flow, leading to a higher discharge. Finally, $\frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x}$ is the **Hydraulic Head Gradient** and gives the decrease in hydraulic head ($H$) over a certain distance in the flow direction ($x$). Since hydraulic head differences are the cause of flow, a large gradient leads to a large discharge.

>[!Note]
>
>There are many cases where the conductivity and thickness of an aquifer are unknown, while the [[Conductance]] $kD$ could be measured. Therefore, the separate values for $k$ and $D$ are often replaced with the combination $kD$

>[!Question]
>
>The hydraulic heads measured in an aquifer are 125 and 123 m a.s.m.l., measured in piezometers that are 90 m apart. The conductance is 500 m$^2$/d. What is the discharge for a 40-m-wide part of the aquifer?

>>$$
>>

The flow can also be considered per unit of width. Then the discharge $Q$ is divided by $B$ and reduced from three dimensions (discharge is in m$^3$/d) to two, and called the [[Two-Dimensional Discharge]] ($q$, in m$^2$/d). This quantity is useful when the vertical cross-section is similar for a longer distance (for example flow under a long dam) or when the water balance approach is used to compute flow magnitude (this will be explained later). It is computed as 

$$
q=kD \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x} \tag{14.2}
$$

>>q=kD \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x} =500 \times \frac{125 - 123}{90}=11 \, \text{m}^2 \, \text{d}^{-1}

>>

The flow can also be considered per unit of area. Then the discharge $Q$ is divided by both $B$ and $D$ and reduced from 3 dimensions to 1, and called the [[Flux Density]] ($v$, in m/d). The flux density is not the same as the flow velocity since part of the soil is occupied by soil particles (which will be explained later). The flux density is computed as 

$$
v=k \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x} \tag{14.3}
$$

## 14.3 Darcy's Law for Vertical Flow
[[Darcy's Law]] can also be used for vertical flow, for example to compute infiltration or seepage flux densities through aquitards. The flux density through the aquitard can be computed with Eq. 14.3. Since the hydraulic heads are measured above and below the aquitard, the distance $\Delta x$ equals the thickness of the layer $D$ in this case. Since aquitards are often characterised by their resistance ($c$), Equations 10.2 and 14.3 are often combined to 

$$
v=\frac{\Delta H}{c} \tag{14.4}
$$

Vertical flux densities related to seepage or infiltration can easily be compared to other fluxes in mm/d, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, and used in a water balance. The discharge and two-dimensional discharge are not used for vertical flow in practice, but they could be computed in a similar way.

>[!Question]
>There is vertical flow across a resistance layer with a resistance of 200 d. The water level in piezometer A is 105 cm below sea level. The water level in piezometer B is 120 cm below sea level. Derive the direction and compute the magnitude of this flux

>>v=\frac{\Delta H}{c} = \frac{1.20 - 1.05}{200}=0.00075 \, \text{m} \, \text{d}^{-1} = 0.75 \, \text{mm} \, \text{d}^{-1}

## 14.4 Using Isohypse Maps for Darcy's Law
[[Isohypses]] give the groundwater level at certain locations, hence the slope of the groundwater table can be read from isohypse maps. Since in phreatic aquifers the hydraulic head is equal to the groundwater level, the hydraulic head gradient ($\frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x}$) is equal to the slope of the groundwater table. 

![[Pasted image 20240222223539.jpg]]

From the isohypse map above the hydraulic head gradient at point A can be read. The hydraulic head gradient can be computed as the difference between the groundwater levels belonging to the isohypses closest to point A (here $\Delta H=21-20=1$ m) divided by the distance between the isohypses in the flow direction (perpendicular to the isohypses, here 1 km). Hence, the hydraulic head gradient in this example is $\frac{1}{1000}=0.001$.

The hydraulic head gradient can be used as input for Darcy's Law. When the conductivity is known the horizontal flux density at point A can be computed using Eq. 14.3. When the aquifer thickness (or conductance) is known, the 2-dimensional discharge at point A can be computed using Eq. 14.2

>[!Question]
>Suppose that the conductance of the aquifer at point B (in the image above) is 350 m$^2$/d. Compute the 2-dimensional discharge
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>The distance between the isohypses closest to B is about 800 m. 
>>
>>$$
>>q=kD \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x} =350 \, \frac{21-20}{800} = 0.44 \, \text{m}^2 \, \text{d}^{-1} 
>>$$
>>

## 14.5 Using Equipotential Lines for Darcy's Law
Equipotential lines are often used to compute 2-dimensional discharge in a vertical cross-section. To get the hydraulic head gradient at a certain point, the difference between the $H$-values of the 2 nearest equipotential lines is divided by the distance between them.

In curvilinear square flow nets the distance between equipotential lines equals the distance between flow lines. This simplifies the computation of the 2-dimensional discharge through a flow tube (the area between the 2 flow lines). When applying Eq. 14.2 for a flow tube instead of the entire aquifer, $D$ is replaced with the height of that flow tube. Since this is the same as the distance between the flow lines and thus the distance between the equipotential lines, $D$ is replaced with $\Delta x$, which cancels out against the $\Delta x$ in the hydraulic gradient. The same method can be applied to square flow nets on a horizontal plane (with isohypses or equipotential lines)
