# 9. Groundwater Usage
## 9.1 Introduction
Groundwater is less visible than surface water, but plays a large role in natural processes and supplying water for society. This chapter gives examples of the usage of groundwater for drinking water and industry, the relation between groundwater depth and agricultural or natural vegetation and the effect of groundwater flow on the spread of pollutants. The importance of groundwater for Dutch spatial planning is further demonstrated. 

---
## 9.2 Water Supply
### 9.2.1 Drinking Water
In many places in the world, water is extracted from the soil to be used as drinking water. The quality of this water is often good, but there are exceptions

The amount of 5 L/d is defined as the minimum amount of water people need according to the World Health Organization. Without drinking water, a human being survives only a couple of days.

Only 1.5% of tap water is used for human consumption in the Netherlands (drinks and food). More water is used for showering and bathing (38%), flushing the toilet (29%), cleaning the dishes (6%), and irrigating gardens or washing cars (8%). 

To assess the impact of groundwater extraction in terms of water availability, the extraction can be compared to the other water balance terms. The water used for the whole population of the Netherlands is about $838 \cdot 10^6$ m$^3$. The biggest share ($544 \cdot 10^6$ m$^3$) of this amount is extracted from groundwater. When this is compared to the precipitation - evaporation for the area of the Netherlands, it becomes clear that about 6% of the precipitation surplus is used for drinking water.

>[!Question]
>Consider 2 areas with groundwater extraction. Area A is 5000 km$^2$ large, has a precipitation surplus of 350 mm/y, and 175 million m$^3$ groundwater is extracted. Area B is 2000 km$^2$ large, has a precipitation surplus of 200 mm/y, and 500 million m$^3$ groundwater is extracted. Which fraction (%) of the precipitation surplus is extracted in these areas?
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>A: 10%
>>
>>B: 125% In this area, more water is extracted than groundwater recharge, meaning that groundwater levels will go down
>>

>[!Note]
>The computation above spreads the water use over the whole land surface, but groundwater cannot be extracted everywhere, so a larger part of the precipitation surplus is extracted from some locations. Sometimes, surface water is led to the extraction sites to infiltrate and compensate for the extracted water. Due to the elevation differences, surface water supply is not economically feasible for the main Dutch drinking water extraction sites, which are located on the elevated sandy soils in the East and South

### 9.2.2 Industry
Drinking water companies also deliver groundwater to industries, companies and other destinations such as the fire brigade and recreational areas. The industry itself also extracts groundwater for cleaning, cooling or for their industrial processes. Together, industry uses 535 million m$^3$/y, a similar amount as extracted by drinking water companies. Domestic and industrial water use together leads to an average annual water use of 30 mm/y. This is quite a large amount, which has led to **desiccation** (the process of becoming too dry) of some areas. 

In addition to the amount of available water, the water quality of groundwater determines whether extraction is possible. During the last century, the quality of the drinking water deteriorated in some areas. As a result of excessive fertiliser and pesticide applications in intensive agriculture, nitrate and pesticides leached to the groundwater and the polluted water had to be purified before it could be used. 

### 9.2.3 Agriculture
Crops transpire huge amounts of water via their open stomata. In the Netherlands, about 6500 L/p/d are used for food production, which is much more than the 135 L/d for domestic use. Plants extract water from the topsoil, where their roots are situated, leading to lower soil moisture contents in the root zone. This can be replenished by precipitation or capillary rise from the groundwater. 

In the Netherlands, there is a precipitation surplus in winter and a precipitation deficit in summer. Therefore, water stored in the root zone in the winter season is another important source of water during crop growth in the summer season. The same is the case in areas with a distinct wet and dry season, for example caused by the monsoon. 

>[!Note]
>The [[Capillary Rise]] may form a valuable water source for vegetation in drought periods. However, the spatial variation in capillary rise is large. This water flux depends on the distance between the groundwater table and the root zone. When the groundwater is deep, capillary rise cannot occur because a too large suction would be needed to move the water far upwards, against gravity. In coarse material, the water film around the soil particles in the unsaturated zone is thin and discontinuous, which makes water movement more difficult as well. 
>
>Very shallow groundwater tables, on the other hand, can also cause problems. Plant roots need air (oxygen) and therefore a very shallow groundwater table can also lead to yield reductions. In addition, when groundwater is shallow, clayey, loamy and peaty soils become soft and cattle and cultivation vehicles may compact or damage the topsoil. The optimal water level differs per crop and soil type. Hence, water managers put much effort into maintaining optimal groundwater levels by making use of drainpipes, ditches and channels. This infrastructure is designed based on the past climate, but may have to be altered to cope with the future climate change. 

>[!Info]
>In semi-arid areas, most or all water for crop production comes from irrigation. Next to the water availability, the salt concentration of the water can become problematic. Long-term irrigation brings large amounts of dissolved salts to irrigated soils. In addition, the capillary rise may transport salt from the groundwater to the root zone, where it will accumulate. High salinity concentrations in the root zone make it hard for plants to extract enough water from the soil to meet their transpiration demand. Therefore, in semi-arid areas extra irrigation water should be applied to leach the soil and groundwater levels should be well-controlled to prevent waterlogging and salinisation by capillary rise. 


---
## 9.3 Groundwater and Nature
Natural vegetation also depends on groundwater, because it requires enough water for transpiration, while at the same time enough air should be available for the roots. Some plant types need very wet environments and can transport air within their stems and roots. These wet vegetation types often require stable and shallow groundwater tables because groundwater tables affect the main physical, chemical and biological processes in the soil. 

>[!Example]
>An example is the degradation of organic matter, which determines the amount of available nutrients. Nutrient status is one of the most important factors in plant competition.

The chemical composition of groundwater has a large effect on vegetation type. Rainwater has a different composition than seepage water (groundwater flowing upwards and out of the ground in valleys) which has been in the soil for centuries or even thousands of years. Some plants require water with the chemical composition of rainwater, while others require water with the chemical composition of seepage water. 

>[!Important]
>In summary, vegetation requires a combination of location factors that belong to their species. They could require fresh or salty water, wet or dry conditions, nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor conditions, etc. The local groundwater flow conditions determine all of these factors to a large extent. In cases where humans have influenced the regional water management, for example to recover or protect so-called blue grassland vegetation, proper analysis of groundwater flow determines the succes or failure of these measures.

## 9.4 Groundwater and Pollution (`Optional`)
Groundwater can be polluted with different compounds and from different sources. In most areas, agriculture is the largest source of contamination. High amounts of nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) and pesticides leak from agricultural fields to the groundwater (and the surface water). The industry discharges polluted water or gases with heavy metals, solvents and many other organic micropollutants. Besides that, hormones and other particles reach the soil and groundwater. Since groundwater flows very slowly, pollution can stay in the ground for decades or centuries and historical pollution can cause problems for future generations. 

In order to secure public health, agriculture and the environment, universities, institutes, consultancy firms and governmental agencies ask the following essential questions:
- Do pollutants reach the groundwater, or are they stored or broken down in the unsaturated zone?
- When these pollutants reach the groundwater, in which direction will they move?
- How fast do the pollutants move in the groundwater?
- What is the effect of these pollutants on drinking water or industrial water extracted from groundwater, on residential areas or on surface water quality?

# 10. Layers and Soil Properties
## 10.1 Introduction
The subsurface consists of layers of geological deposits, which can either be loose soil material such as sand, clay and gravel ([[Unconsolidated Sediment]]) or bedrock ([[Consolidated Sediment]]). In delta areas, the bedrock can be hundreds of meters deep and does not affect groundwater flow, while in mountainous areas it can be at the land surface. This chapter contains many examples from delta areas with unconsolidated sediment, but groundwater flow through consolidated sediment can be measured, analysed and computed in the same way. 

Water flow through the soil depends on the properties of these geological deposits, in particular the thickness of the layers and the soil type.

---
## 10.2 Soil Properties: Conductivity and Porosity
From a hydrological point of view, soil material can be characterised using 2 properties: the conductivity and the porosity

The [[Permeability|Conductivity]] (also called [[Permeability]], $k$ in m/d) is a measure of how easily water can flow through the soil material. The conductivity is used to compute groundwater flow.

Water flows less easily through unsaturated soil, as water can only flow through the water film attached to the soil particles. The maximum conductivity is reached when the soil is saturated: the [[Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity]]. Since this chapter concerns groundwater (i.e. saturated conditions), we always mean saturated hydraulic conductivity when we use the term conductivity.

Some soils have a layered structure, for example when loose material is compacted, when thin layers of clay are deposited in sand or when the clay is fractured. In that case, the conductivity is higher in one direction than the other and is called [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]]. The opposite, [[Isotropy|isotropic]], means that the conductivity is the same in all directions. Anisotropy is common in consolidated sediments, where fractures in the bedrock have a large impact on the flow direction. 

The [[Porosity]] ($n$ in %) is the fraction of the soil volume that is not taken up by soil particles. 

>[!Note]
>In saturated soils, this gives the water fraction in the soil. 

>[!Info]
>Typical values of conductivity and porosity of some soil types
>
| Soil material | Subtype | Conductivity $k$ (m/d) | Porosity $n$ (%) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Gravel |  | > 250 | 25 - 40 |
| Sand | Coarse | 5 - 100 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Fine | 1 - 5 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Very fine | 0.2 - 0.5 | 30 - 50 |
| Clay | With large fractures | 10 - 100 | 45 - 70 |
|  | Some macropores or fractures | 0.5 - 2 | 35 - 60 |
|  | No macropores or fractures | < 0.005 | 35 - 60 |
| Peat | Above groundwater table | 0.1 - 5 | 60 - 85 |
|  | Below groundwater table | 0.0001 - 0.5 | 50 - 80 |


Some of the water is attached to soil particles and does not move. The [[Effective Porosity]] ($n_e$ in %) is the fraction of the soil volume that is filled with water that can move, and is used to compute flow velocities and residence times. The effective porosity is always somewhat smaller than the total porosity.

Mineral soils with large grains (gravel and course sand) have a higher conductivity than soil types with small particles (clay). Large particles cannot be packed firmly together, which leads to large pore spaces. Water can then move easily from one pore to the next because the 'channels' between the particles are wider, resulting in a higher flow velocity. The porosity is higher for clay than gravel, since small particles take up less space. However, the range of porosities found for certain soil types overlap with each other, while the conductivities of different soil types vary by several orders of magnitude.

Organic soils (peat) consist of partly decomposed plant material, which contains much water (very high porosity), but this water is fixed in stems and leaves, leading to a very low conductivity. 

>[!Note]
>Even within one soil type, there can be large differences: for clays the presence of fractures is very important, while for sands the grain size is important. For peat soils, the degree of aeration (degree to which peat is exposed to air during part of the year) determines the saturated conductivity

---
## 10.3 Layer Properties: Conductance and Resistance
Soil particles have been deposited in layers, in different time periods and under different conditions. These layers are often horizontal (although they can tilt) and have a certain **layer thickness** ($D$, in m)

The [[Permeability|Conductivity]] $k$ and layer thickness $D$ together determine the capacity of a layer to transport water horizontally or to limit water flow vertically. 

The horizontal transportation capacity is expressed by the [[Conductance]] or Transmissivity ($kD$, in m$^2$ / d). It is simply the product of $k$ and $D$: 

$$
kD = k \cdot D \tag{10.1}
$$

This equation shows that a large volume of water can flow horizontally through a thick layer of permeable material. 

>[!Info]
>A conductance below 250 m$^2$ / d is considered very low, 750 m$^2$ / d is moderately high and above 2000 m$^2$ / d is very high

The capacity to flow vertically is expressed by the [[Resistance]] ($c$ in days): 

$$
c=\frac{D}{k} \tag{10.2}
$$

This equation shows that a thick layer of poorly permeable material hampers flow.

>[!Question]
>Q: Compute the conductance and resistance of a deposit of 20 m fine sand
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>The conductivity $k$ of fine sand is about 3 m/d
>>
>>Conductance $kD=3\cdot20=60$ m$^2$ / d
>>
>>Resistance $c=\frac{20}{3}\approx 7$ d

---
## 10.4 Geologic Layers
A layer that consists of permeable material (i.e. with high conductivity, for example gravel or sand) is called an [[Aquifer]] or permeable layer. Aquifers can transport water easily and are characterised by their conductance ($kD$). An [[Aquitard]], confining unit or poorly permeable layer is a bad transporter of water and often consists of clays or soil with much organic material. Their ability to seal off aquifers is measured in terms of resistance. An [[Aquiclude]] is a layer for which the resistance is so high that no water flows through at all

Sometimes an aquifer varies in size. This is the case when the aquifer contains the groundwater table. Since the groundwater level varies, thee thickness of the layer through which groundwater flows changes as well, and thereby its conductance. Such an aquifer is called a [[Phreatic Aquifer]]. 

When an aquifer is enclosed by an aquitard above and below, this aquifer is known as a [[Confined Aquifer]]. By definition, this layer is always completely saturated. 

Groundwater does not flow until the center of the Earth. There is a certain lower boundary beneath which water does not take part in the hydrological cycle anymore. This is called the [[Hydrological Base]].

>[!Question]
>Which Aquitard has a higher resistance: a 5 m thick layer of clay without fractures or a 20 mm thick layer of clay with some fractures?
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>The conductivity $k$ of clay without fractures is at most 0.005 m/d and for clay with some fractures $k$ is at least 0.5 m/d.
>>
>>For the clay layer without fractures: 
>>
>>$$
>>c=\frac{D}{k}=\frac{5}{0.005}=1000 \text{d}
>>$$
>>
>>For the clay layer with fractures: 
>>
>>$$
>>c=\frac{D}{k}=\frac{20}{0.5}=40 \text{d}
>>$$
>>
>>Since 1000 > 40, the (thinner) clay layer without fractures has a higher resistance

---
## 10.5 Combining Layers
When two or more aquifers are positioned on top of each other, the Effective Conductivity of the combination can be computed. This is a weighted average of the conductivities of the separate layers. The combined conductance (for aquifers) is the sum of the conductances of the separate layers - the total conductance becomes larger since the flowing water can be divided over multiple layers. The combined resistance for aquitards is the sum of the resistances of the separate layers - the total resistance becomes larger since the water flow is first hampered by passing the first layer, then the second, etc.

>[!Question]
>An Aquifer consists of 3 deposits: 10 m of gravel ($k=230$ m/d) on top of 2 m of fine sand ($k = 8$ m/d) on top of 20 m of coarse sand ($k=85$ m/d). What are the effective conductivity and total conductance of this combined layer?
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>
>>The effective conductivity is the weighted average $k$: 
>>
>>$$
>>\frac{230\cdot 10 + 8 \cdot 2 + 85 \cdot 20}{10+2+20}=126 \, \text{m} \, \text{d}^{-1} 
>>$$
>>
>>The total conductance is the sum of the $kD$'s of the layers: 
>>
>>$$
>>kD=230 \cdot 10 + 8\cdot 2 + 85 \cdot 20 = 4016 \, \text{m}^2 \, d^{-1}
>>$$

# 11. Groundwater Level
## 11.1 Introduction
Water in the soil is located in pores between solid particles of sand, clay, peat, and organic carbon. If you dig a deep hole, it will mostly fill itself with water. The border between water and air in the hole is called the [[Groundwater Table]] or the Phreatic Plane. The elevation of the groundwater table is usually measured as groundwater level with respect to mean sea level (abbreviated as a.m.s.l) or groundwater depth with respect to land surface. Using the land surface is only possible for local studies since the land elevation varies in space. 

---
## 11.2 Groundwater and Soil Moisture
Water below the Groundwater Table is called [[Groundwater]] and above the groundwater table is called [[Soil Moisture]]

>[!Info]
>Groundwater has a positive pressure (compared to the atmospheric pressure), while soil moisture has a negative pressure. Even though the pressure is lower than the atmosphere, the zone above the groundwater table still contains water as a result of adhesive and cohesive forces which make water 'stick' to the soil particles.

Just above the groundwater table, there is a thin zone (0-30 cm) where the pressure is just below atmospheric pressure and all pores are filled with water: the [[Capillary Fringe]]. The capillary fringe is part of the saturated zone, but not part of the groundwater since the water particles are sticking to the soil particles rather than sitting on top of the water below (and exerting pressure on it). The water in the capillary fringe is therefore technically soil moisture and not groundwater. Since the capillary fringe is only a thin layer, it is often neglected in practical applications and the saturated zone is considered equal to the groundwater zone.

>[!Info]
>Groundwater levels can be measured in a Piezometer (also called groundwater well or groundwater tube). A piezometer is a pvc or metal tube with a cross-section of 5-10 centimeters. It is perforated over a length of about 1 m at the bottom end and the holes are covered with a gauze to prevent soil particles from flowing into the tube. The perforated part is called the filter. A hole is drilled in the ground and the piezometer is installed deep enough that the filter is always below the groundwater table. If the perforated part is below the groundwater table, the piezometer will fill with water and the water inside the tube will rise to the groundwater level. This process will take some time because the water in the soil moves slowly. 
>
>The groundwater depth can be measured manually with a special type of measuring tape, which is lowered into the tube and makes a sound when the tip touches the water surface. Usually, the level is measured compared to the top of the tube and converted to a level about mean sea level, using the elevation of the tube. 

---
## 11.3 Heads
Groundwater droplets experience forces that may push them in a certain direction. The forces originate from differences in energy between different locations. In hydrology and hydraulics, these energies are usually measured as the length of a water column that would lead to the same [[Potentiële Energie|Potential Energy]]. The total energy of a droplet is called the **Potential** and the corresponding water column height is called the [[Hydraulic Head]] ($H$ in m). The hydraulic head consists of 2 components: the [[Elevation Head]] ($z$ in m) and the [[Pressure Head]] ($h$ in m): 

$$
H=z+h \tag{11.1} 
$$

The elevation head is simply the elevation of the water droplet compared to a certain reference level (e.g. sea level). 

The pressure head is the local pressure as it would be measured using a pressure meter (converted to a water column length). This pressure is mostly caused by the pressure of the groundwater above it, but it is often increased (when groundwater is pushed to the location of interest from somewhere else) or decreased (when groundwater is led away from the location). 

As mentioned earlier, groundwater droplets always experience a positive pressure compared to atmospheric pressure. In hydrology, atmospheric pressure is used as a reference for the pressure head (zero pressure). Hence, the pressure equals zero at all places that are accessible to the atmosphere (for example at the groundwater table). Although atmospheric pressure varies in space and time, it may be considered constant for groundwater applications, which concern slow (years to centuries) and regional (10-50 km) processes.

![[Pasted image 20240220230018.jpg]]

The figure above displays the elevation head, pressure head and hydraulic head measured in a [[Phreatic Aquifer]]. The measurements of the piezometer hold for the soil volume directly around the filter since that is where the tube is in connection with the groundwater. The hydraulic head $H$ is constant within the piezometer. This means that the hydraulic head $H$ at the water table is the same as the hydraulic head at the filter. At the groundwater table, $h=0$, so $H=z$ so the hydraulic head in a piezometer is equal to the water level in the piezometer. Note that further down in the piezometer, the elevation head is smaller but the pressure head is higher (a larger water column sitting on the droplet), leading to the same hydraulic head.

>[!Note]
>
>The hydraulic head can be measured in the same way in confined aquifers and aquitards. However, the water level in the piezometer may not correspond to the groundwater level, because the groundwater level belongs to another hydrogeologic layer. 

---
## 11.4 Flow Direction
Differences in hydraulic heads cause groundwater flow. This is illustrated for two reservoirs with different water levels.
