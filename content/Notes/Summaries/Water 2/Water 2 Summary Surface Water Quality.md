# 6. Chemistry of Water
## 6.1 What is Water Quality?
Really pure water does not exist in nature. There are always substances dissolved or particles that float in the water (suspended matter). The amount and characteristics of dissolved and floating substances determine the "water quality"

Actually, this is a wrong term, as in fact we mean the composition or function of the water. "Quality" is a relative, human concept, meaning the composition of the water related to the function of the water. So, ditches can be of good quality for fishes and water plants, but that does not necessarily mean it can be used for drinking water. Though, water quality is used so often that we will also use it in this chapter to indicate the composition of the water

In surface waters many processes take place that influence the water quality. These processes are mainly related to physical and chemical characteristics of the water. This is in coherence with the structure and the characteristics of water molecules. The water molecule has a high dipole amount and therefore a strong polar character. The strong polar character results in a strong attraction and cohesion between the water molecules, and therefore water at $20 \degree \text{C}$ is a liquid instead of a gas, despite the low molecular weight. We assume that most knowledge related to the physical characteristics are known and in this chapter we will focus on the substances in the water, the chemical composition of surface water and a number of problems that we encounter with surface water.

>[!Important]
>The chemical composition of groundwater and surface water is mainly dependent on the environment that has been in contact with the water.

Even without human interference the composition of natural water can vary enormously. This is the result of contact between groundwater and rocks and soils, of which the composition can vary strongly. During this contact substances dissolve and obviously the timespan of the contact determines which and how much of the substances will dissolve. The chemical composition of the groundwater is already discussed in paragraph [[Reader Water 2-Chapter 2.2-Chemical Aspects of Groundwater|2.2]]. 

Surface waters are fed by groundwater. Next to that there are interactions with atmosphere, rainfall and evaporation, and input of terrestrial organic matter (e.g. leaves). Also, runoff from soils, erosion and sedimentation are important for the composition of surface waters. However, in many cases processes that take place in the water itself (primary production, chemical reactions) will change the 'natural' composition of water. Next to natural processes the water composition of almost every freshwater on earth is influenced more or less by humans: discharges from sewage systems, both with and without purification of the waste water, leaching nutrients and pesticides, acid rain and other deposits from air pollution, etc. Apart from the dissolved suspended substances, other characteristics can influence the function of water systems. For instance colour, taste and smell, turbidity and radioactivity. 

The different components that are present in surface water in short are:
- **Organic Matter**: This consists of biodegradable organic material, like dead organisms in water and influx from surrounding area like leaves and branches. Roughly it can be separated in floating organic material and dissolved organic material. The organic material is degraded by organisms, finally resulting in $\ce{ CO2 }$ and water. However, all kind of intermediate substances are produced, like for instance humic acids and fulvic acids. These acids give the water a yellow-brown colour, which often can be found in peatlands and forest lakes. Biodegration of organic material consumes dissolved oxygen from the water. When this happens at large scale the depletion of oxygen can cause problems, like in case of discharge of waste water. 
- **Nutrients**: The most important nutrients in surface waters are nitrogen ($\ce{ N }$) and phosphorus ($\ce{P}$). The amount and which nutrient can be found in a system mostly depends on the catchment area. Many waters in sparsely populated areas, situated in catchment areas with sand and granite, are often **Oligotrophic** (low in nutrients). Other lakes also in sparsely populated areas, situated in catchment areas that are nutrient richer and sensitive for erosion, are **mesotrophic**. In a delta like the Netherlands with the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt most surface waters are rather **eutrophic** (high in nutrients). The last decades many oligotrophic and natural mesotrophic waters are artificially enriched with nutrients from households, industries and agriculture. This process is called **Eutrophication**.
- **Gasses**: Oxygen ($\ce{O2}$) is the most important gas, essential for the survival of aerobic organisms. The oxygen balance will be discussed in paragraph [[Reader Water 2-Chapter 3.3-Oxygen Balance|3.3]]. Other important gases are $\ce{CO2}$ and $\ce{N2}$. When organisms respirate and degrade, organic matter oxygen is used and $\ce{CO2}$ is produced. $\ce{N2}$ is produced during [[Denitrification]]. The exchange of gasses in water with the atmosphere will be discussed in paragraph [[Reader Water 2-Chapter 3.2-Transport and Conversion Processes|3.2]]. 
- **Toxicants**: In this era the high development of chemical and related industries resulted in an increased production of raw materials, semi-finished products, appliances and consumer goods. In many production processes, water is used and disposed that can be contaminated. This causes many problems with toxicants, like heavy metals, chlorinated hydrocarbonates, pesticites, cyanides, etc. Also use of toxic substances in agriculture and households contribute to water pollution. In general the management policy is focused on prevention, so prevent these substances from entering the water systems. Some toxicants like DDT (an insecticide) are forbidden now because of the combination of toxicity and persistence. Toxicants will be discussed in paragraph [[Reader Water 2-Chapter 3.5-Micropollutants|3.5]].

## 6.3 Problems with Water Quality
Problems with the quality of surface water can be caused by a shortage or overload of certain materials. For example not enough oxygen will lead to dead fish, too many nutrients will lead to algae dominance, or organisms will die with too many toxicants. Native substances (nutrients, oxygen) can be present in too low or too high amounts

The effect of a substance depends on the concentration. With the load of a certain substance not only the amount is important but also in what water volume it is discharged. The change in concentration of a substance is determined by transport (influx - outflow) and local processes. That can be physical, chemical and biological processes. This can be expressed as: 

$$
\frac{dC}{dt}= \text{influx - outflow + processes} \tag{6.1} 
$$

in which:
- $C$ is the concentration
- $t$ is the time

Whether transport or local processes are dominant for the concentration differs per type of compound. 

The load of pollution can come from a point or a diffuse source. A **point source** can be located exactly, for example a discharge point of an industry. An example of a **diffuse source** is runoff of nutrients from agricultural soils. Dry and wet deposition of acid substances (acid rain) or micro-pollutants is also an example of diffuse pollution. 

After ages of fighting high water and flooding at present drought is a problem in certain areas. This is a quantity problem, though it can also affect water quality. A measure to decrease the drought is the influx of 'foreign' water. This can be a problem when the chemical composition of the foreign water differs from the native water. In the Netherlands the impact of the Rhine is large, and when foreign water enters an area it is often directly or indirectly coming form the Rhine. The eutrophic Rhine water can cause eutrophication when it is used to supply water in dry oligotrophic areas.

# 7. Transport and Conversion Processes
## 7.1 Water Flow and Mixing
The concentration of substances on a certain time and place in the surface water is determined by the water flow and mixing processes in the water. When the water flows dissolved and suspended elements will be transported. This is called [[Advection]] or **Advective Behaviour**. Also in standing water like lakes and reservoirs local water flows are present leading to a certain mixing of water with material or properties like temperature. Also in running waters like rivers, mixing takes place due to a combination of different flow velocities along the width and the depth caused by turbulence. With turbulence we mean circular movement in the water that occur on different scales. Frictions along interfaces (like banks and bottoms) occur and are visible as whirls behind a boot for instance. This turbulence contributed to the spreading of a pollution that is loaded from the water side. Commonly, those local turbulences and whirls are not analysed separately but the effect can be summarised with the term [[Dispersion]] or **dispersive transport**. Like diffusion this mixing behaviour is described [[Fick's Law]] (which will be explained in continuation courses). Dispersion takes place on a larger scale than diffusion, which is a molecular process ([[Brownian Movement]]). Sometimes it is also important to take into account vertical dispersion (like the transport of warm water in a lake; it floats on colder water). In other cases it is important to study suspersion in the longitudinal direction. For example, when an accident happens on the Rhine, and perople want to know when the pollution arrives at an intake point of drinking water. By advection the peak of the concentration will move with the water velocity downstream, and with longitudinal dispersion the profile of the concentration will stretch and flatten out.

## 7.2 Lake Stratification
In deep lakes different layers in the water column can be formed especially during the summer period. This is called **Stratification**, and is the result of different temperatures at different depths in the lake. Therefore it is also referred to as **Thermal Stratification**. 

The top layer is called the [[Epilimnion]] and is in contact with the atmosphere, so the temperature is high and the layer is mixed due to wind. 

At the bottom there is the [[Hypolimnion]] which is much colder due to lack of incoming light and lack of mixing with he upper layer. 

In between these two layers there is a, generally small, layer where the temperature decreases quickly: the [[Metalimnion]] or **thermocline**

![[20240228_161732.jpg]]

Clearly the development of stratification is driven by physical processes (changing density of water with different temperature), however, there are important consequences for lake chemistry and ecology as well. In the epilimnion most of the primary production takes place, mainly algae growth. Here the light conditions are good, and temperature is high. Due to primary production and reaeration from the atmosphere dissolved oxygen concentration is generally good. In contrast, the hypolimnion is a dark layer where the dissolved oxygen concentration is low and can even be depleted (anoxic). Here organic matter, e.g. sinking of dead algae material from the epilimnion, is decomposed consuming oxygen from the water. Because of absence of primary production and reaeration from the atmosphere anoxic conditions can easily exist.

## 7.3 Resuspension
Suspended particles have a major role in the turbidity of rivers and lakes. Except algae species that can regulate their floating capacities or can swim, all particles sink to the bottom. **Resuspension** of particles is caused by water movement along the interface water-sediment. This causes a "drag-force" that is also called **Sheer Stress**. Whether the water movement will result in resuspension depends on the flow velocity of the water and the characteristics of the sediment. The minimum force needed for a particle to resuspend is called the **Critical Sheer Stress**. This is different for every particle and is determined by shape, size and mass. The resuspension flux can be described as follows: 

$$ 
\phi_r = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for} \, \tau \le \tau_k \\
C_r \bigl(\frac{\tau}{\tau_k}-1 \bigr), & \text{for} \tau \gt \tau_k
\end{cases}
\tag{7.1}
$$

Where:
- $\phi_r$ is the resuspension flux [g m$^2$ d$^{-1}$] 
- $\tau$ is the shear stress [Pa]
- $\tau_k$ is the critical shear stress [Pa]
- $C_r$ is the resuspension constant [g m$^2$ d$^{-1}$] 

In rivers, streams, etc. water flow is generating the energy for resuspension. In lakes the water movements at the sediment (giving resuspension) are mostly caused by waves, but also fish that search for food in the bottom contribute. Water plants can decrease resuspension by limiting the water flow and stabilising the sediment with their roots. In many shallow likes there is a short cycle for resuspension and settling of sediment and algae. The continuous process of sedimentation and resuspension determines the concentration of suspended material in shallow lakes. The shallower the lake the faster the cycle is finished. When the water of a shallow lake becomes less dynamic for example with a layer of ice, the resuspension decreases strongly and the lake can become clear in a short period of time. In deep lakes there is thermal stratification during summer which reduces the mixing. In such a situation the particles will not get in resuspension easily, once they are settled in the deeper part. In shallow lakes mixing can decrease during summer and the water movement just above the sediment can decrease strongly. This results in sedimentation in a shallow lake. However, when the water movement reaches above a critical limit, for instance because of strong wind, the sediment is resuspended again. 

### 7.3.1 Resuspsension by Waves
Waves develop by the friction of wind on water surfaces. The water movement caused by waves is generally complex, but results in horizontal movements along the bottom that can cause resuspension. The shallower the water the stronger the maximum current velocity along the bottom. Resuspension takes place when a critical water movement along the bottom is exceeded. Fine sludge and organic material will be resuspended faster than sand. Moreover, the sediment can consolidate when there is little disturbance or when a layer of bacteria and benthic algae has developed: in such cases resuspension reduces, because the critical water velocity for resuspension increases. 

Although resuspension by waves depends on many factors, it can be predicted with a rather simple rule: resuspension occurs when waves reach the bottom; this might happen if the wavelength is longer than two times the depth of the lake. Generally, the wavelength increases with wind speed. Next to that, the wavelength depends strongly on the **fetch**. This is the length of the water surface on which the wind has impact. This can be observed in small lakes where there is wind. Close to the protected banks the water is calm, but the waves grow with the distance to the open water. 

>[!Important]
>In general for a lake two characteristics are important for resuspension by waves:\
>1. The size of the lake. Large lakes have longer fetches and are therefore more susceptible to resuspension
>2. The depth of the lake. Deep lakes are less susceptible than shallow lakes, because resuspension occurs when the wavelength is 2 times the depth


### 7.3.2 Resuspension by Fish
In shallow lakes a large part of the fish population eats invertebrates living in and on the sediment like mosquito larvae, snails and worms. Especially bream and carp are known for that. During foraging they ingest the sediment and filter the "benthic invertebrates" out of it. Fine sludge from the bottom will then be resuspended. In lake sediments you can find small craters that are made by foraging fishes, which are called **Benthivorous** fishes. Their resuspension effect can be very large. 

### 7.3.3 The Effect of Water Plants
Water plants decrease resuspension of sediment to a large extent. This can be concluded from some large lakes that were clear till the water plants disappeared and resuspension started with turbid water as a result. Not only submerged water plants but also reed-like plants can decrease resuspension in small lakes. The effect water plants have on reducing sediment resuspension depends on the vegetation density and  structure.

## 7.4 Physical Processes of Dissolved and Suspended Material
Mixing and resuspension, as described in the previous section, are physical processes of the water itself. Now we will explain some other important physical processes that influence the substances in the water directly. 

Exchange of substances between the air and thew water (e.g. volatilisation) is important for oxygen, $\ce{CO2}$ and several other volatile pollutants. The ratio between volatilisation and solubility of materials is important for the exchange rate between water and air, next to mixing conditions in the boundary layer. The turbulence in this water layer at the border is determined by the flow velocity, the water depth and the wind. Evaporation of water itself is of great important for the energy balance. 

Sedimentation takes place when particles have a higher density than water. When pollutants are bounded to those particles this results in accumulation in the sediment. Close to the top layer of the sediment the shear stress can be too high and the particles do not settle permanently but concentrate close to the bottom. Therefore a lot of material "rolls" along the bottom of the river downstream. The concentration gradient of particles that develops depends on the ratio between sedimentation and resuspension. 

**Adsorption and Absorption** are physical-chemical processes in which dissolved substances attach to the surface of particles (ad.) or dissolve in those particles (ab.). The attracting forces that cause those attachments are chemical or electrostatic; also important is polarity that determines the solubility of water. Apolar (not polar) organic micro-pollutants like PCB's are poorly soluble in water and tend to attach to organic particles (e.g. detritus). Heavy metals attach mainly to metal oxides but also to organic material. Through the accumulation of pollutants on particles the transport is mainly determined by sedimentation and resuspension, as described earlier. The build-up of pollutants takes place on locations where suspended particles settle like in river floodplains. Especially in urban areas (e.g. harbours) a specific water quality problem occurs: the disposal of polluted sludge and sediment.

## 7.5 Chemical Processes
Precipitation occurs when the solubility of hydroxides, carbonates and phosphates etc. are exceeded. In sediments this happens also for sulphides, especially in marine environments. The formed minerals of hydroxides are often a mixture with all kinds of irregularities in the crystal structure or even amorphous (lacking a definite geometric or crystalline structure). An often seen precipitate is calcium carbonate that develops through intensive algae growth and an increasing pH. 

Coagulation and flocculation are terms that indicate that colloidal molecules (especially with electric loading) lose their stability and therefore can become "solid" and flocculate. This happens often in the transition zone between salt and fresh water leading to high sedimentation (like in the harbour of Rotterdam). In drinking water treatment coagulation and flocculation is used to remove for instance clay particles. Coagulation can co-occur with adsorption: the small particles often have a reactive surface and therefore they will bind dissolved substances. 

Hydrolysis is the decomposition of chemical bindings by reaction with water. pH is important for that. Sometimes decomposition is activated by light energy, so called photolysis, that occurs mainly with some organic compounds. Also oxidation with oxygen under the influence of light, photo-oxidation, is a known decomposition process

## 7.6 Biological Processes
Most conversions of substances take place as a result of biological activity. In water and sediment all kind of micro-organisms are present that can decompose or convert organic materials (sometimes inorganic materials) and the resulting energy is used for new cell material made from part of the organic material or even to produce carbon dioxide. As an electron acceptor oxygen ius mostly used, and when that is not available, nitrate, iron, sulphate and even carbon dioxide can be used by specialised organisms. For the oxygen balance this is of important, but also the nitrogen cycle is influenced strongly by this.

Furthermore, micro-pollutants can decompose harmful pollutants. In general, organic compounds are less decomposable when the carbon chain is longer, with more side-branches, the molecule has more aromatic rings and more hydrogen is substituted by halogens (specially chlorinated). Due to the diversity of structures of many substances there is a large range in the ligespan in the aquatic environment. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are good or very good decomposable; their harmfulness is mainly caused due to the depletion of oxygen. On the other hand, there are PCB's and Pesticides that are often poorly decomposable (persistent). This varies strongly with the environmental situation (redox conditions, adsorption, etc.) and is often quantified by the half-life: the time that is needed to decompose half of the original amount. Because persistent pollutants are llonger in the environment they are more harmful and generally have a stricter legislation. Decomposition of substances by organisms follow normally a 1st-order process. This means that the speed of the process depends on the concentration of the substance. An example is the decomposition of oxygen-bounded substances, or the growth of algae. The change of a substance concentration is a 1st order process: 

$$
\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \tag{7.2}
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the concentration
- $k$ is the 1st-order process rate

The ratge $k$ is positive in case of increase and negative in case of decrease. Assuming a start concentration $C_0$ at $t=0$ the concentration at $t=t$, ($C_t$) can be determined by integrating equation 7.2:

$$
C_t=C_0 \, e^{kt} \tag{7.3}
$$
