# 4. Formulas for Stationary Groundwater Flow
## 4.1 Introduction
In hydrology there are many formulas for the behaviour of groundwater systems. These formulas can be used to answer questions such as "how far apart should ditches be to prevent a field from becoming too wet?", "how wide should a buffer zone around a nature reserve be to prevent it from drying out?" Furthermore, these formulas serve a scientific purpose as they give insight into groundwater systems.

In this section we only present those formulas for stationary groundwater flow which describe the [[Hydraulic Head]] as a function of distance, thus $H=f(x)$.

When deriving formulas, generally, the following steps can be distinguished
1. Limiting the open flow system by defining boundary conditions
2. Simplifying the actual water flow
3. Formulating a differential equation with $H$ as a function of $x$ by combining
   -  The continuity principle
   -  [[Darcy's Law]]
4. Solving the differential equation
5. Applying the boundary conditions

This procedure will be explained in the following sections with some examples

## 4.2 Centerfield Head Difference Between Parallel Ditches using Flow Layer Thickness
During winter time the water table in a field surrounded by ditches has a convex shape (it bulges upward) due to the precipitation surplus. Because a water table that is too high can lead to crop damage, it is relevant for agriculture to be able to describe the shape of the water table. 

The following figure shows the cross-section of an agricultural field:

The derivation of the shape of the water table is done in the five steps specified earlier
