# 1. Rainfall-Runoff Processes
## 1.1 Introduction
Extreme precipitation does not always lead to extreme discharges. Soil and vegetation work as a buffer which smooths and delays the resulting discharge of the often peaky precipitation behaviour. 

The way discharge responds to precipitation depends on many factors, such as
- **The precipitation event**: how long, how intense and where in the catchment does it rain or snow?
- **The temperature**: will snow melt or not?
- **The vegetation**: how much water will be stored on the leaves after a shower? ([[Interception]] storage)
- **The Evapotranspiration**: how much water will evaporate from soil and vegetation?
- **The land surface**: does water infiltrate easily?
- **The thickness of the Unsaturated Zone**: how much water can be stored there?
- **The hydrogeology of the catchment**: how easily does water flow through the soil?
- **The slope of the land surface**: how easily does water flow over the surface and through the shallow soil layers?
- **The river itself (slope, roughness and shape of the cross-section)**: how fast will water flow through the river?
- **Human influences**: are there many weirs, hydro-power reservoirs or drinking water extractions?

Many of these factors influence each other. The evapotranspiration, for example, depends on vegetation, temperature and soil moisture content. These relationships make it a very complex system.

## 1.2 Rainfall-Runoff Models
Due to the complexity of catchments, weather and climate, it is not easy to predict a river's discharge response to a rain shower. In order to have some sort of forecast, we can use a certain type of hydrological model: the [[Rainfall-Runoff Model]]. Rainfall-Runoff models are a simplified representation of hydrological processes within a catchment.
