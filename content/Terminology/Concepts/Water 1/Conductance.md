The horizontal transportation capacity of a soil layer is expressed by the **Conductance** or Transmissivity ($kD$, in m$^2$ / d). It is simply the product of [[Permeability|Conductivity]] $k$ and layer thickness $D$: 

$$
kD = k \cdot D
$$

This equation shows that a large volume of water can flow horizontally through a thick layer of permeable material.

>A conductance below 250 m$^2$ / d is considered very low, 750 m$^2$ / d is moderately high and above 2000 m$^2$ / d is very high

Whereas the conductance looks at the horizontal transportation capacity, its counterpart which looks at the vertical transportation capacity is the [[Resistance]]
