In some situations, water infiltrated but cannot percolate to the groundwater because there is a layer with low [[Permeability]] (bedrock or compacted soil layer) close to the surface which limits water flow. The result is that the soil above this layer becomes saturated, even though it is not in contact with the [[Groundwater]]. The water follows the slope of the semi-impermeable layer. This is called **Interflow** and only occurs during and just after a rain shower, because this small water layer empties quickly.
