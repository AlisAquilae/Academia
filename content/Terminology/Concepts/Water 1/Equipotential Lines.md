Spatial variations in [[Hydraulic Head]] are visualised with **Equipotential Lines**, which connect points with equal hydraulic head (and therefore equal potential). Equipotential lines are used both on maps (top view) and vertical cross-sections.

Since the Hydraulic Head corresponds to the groundwater level in [[Phreatic Aquifer|Phreatic Aquifers]], [[Isohypses]] are a type of Equipotential Lines and we use the terms interchangeably.
