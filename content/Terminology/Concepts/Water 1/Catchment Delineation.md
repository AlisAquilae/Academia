Catchment Delineation, in the context of catchment hydrology, refers to determining the catchment boundary (or [[Water Divide]])

Catchment delineation can be done in several ways:

1. The **Surface Water Divide** is found by following the river channels upstream until their sources and drawing the divide between the channels leading to the outlet and the channels leading to another river. 
2. The **Topographical Water Divide** is found by looking at the topography of the area. This is based on the idea that water follows the highest points in the landscape. This can, however, deviate from the actual water divide, because infiltrating water may hit an impermeable layer in the ground and be led in another direction.
3. The **Groundwater Divide** looks at groundwater flows, and therefore focuses on geological characteristics. The difference between the topographical water divide and the actual water divide is often caused by groundwater, and is therefore least accurate in catchments with a high contribution of groundwater flows.
