The **unsaturated zone** refers to the area above the [[Groundwater Table]]. In the unsaturated zone, the pores are filled with both water and air. Water in the unsaturated zone is called [[Soil Moisture]] or soil water.

>[!Note]
>Technically speaking, above the groundwater table exists the [[Capillary Fringe]], which is completely saturated and therefore still considered to be part of the [[Saturated Zone]]
