The **Drainage Density** $D_d$ (km $\cdot$ km$^{-2}$ or km$^{-1}$) quantifies the abundance of channels: 

$$
D_d = \frac{L_{\text{tot}}}{A}
$$

Where
- $L_{\text{tot}}$ (m) = the total length of all channels in a certain area $A$
- $A$ (m$^2$) = The chosen area (typically a catchment)

>[!Important]
>A high drainage density indicates that a certain area contains many channels (per km$^2$). Consequently, the average distance from a location on land to the nearest channel is small. Water only has to travel a small distance over and through the ground to the surface of water networks

>[!Note]
>Climate, geology, soil, land cover and human activities affect the drainage density

>[!Info]
>In temperate climates, $D_d$ is about 1.5 km$^{-1}$ for natural areas, meaning that 1.5 km of channel is necessary to drain a catchment with an area of 1 km$^2$. In wet climates, more water has to be drained, leading to the formation of more channels and a high drainage density. 

Drainage densities are also high in areas with low soil [[Permeability|Conductivity]]. If it is difficult for water to flow through the ground, water has to flow over the ground and if that happens often, a channel is shaped. Agricultural areas also have a high (man-made) drainage density, especially in lowland areas where shallow groundwater needs to be discharged quickly.
