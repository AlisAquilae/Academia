The energy balance model is a very simple conceptual model which represents the First Law of Thermodynamics: The total energy of any isolated system is constant, i.e. energy can be transformed from one state to the other, but can neither be created or destroyed.

In other words, the energy that comes into the earth must be equal to goes out of the earth: $F_{\text{in}} = F_{\text{out}}$.

The incoming energy consists of short-wave radiation from the sun, and the outgoing energy in the form of long-wave radiation is formed by a combination of the [[Latent Heat Flux]] and the [[Sensible Heat Flux]]
