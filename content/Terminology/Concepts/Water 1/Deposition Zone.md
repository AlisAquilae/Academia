The deposition zone, in the context of [[Catchment Zoning]], refers to the lower course or downstream area of a catchment. This is the delta where the river divides into multiple branches again as a result of the flat landscape, and as a result of the large amount of water and sediment present in the river. We call this area the deposition zone, because the low flow velocity causes sediment to settle

The other zones identified are the [[Production Zone]] and the [[Transport Zone]]
