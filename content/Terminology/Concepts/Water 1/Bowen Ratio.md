When comparing ecosystems on their energy balance, besides looking at [[Albedo]], you should also look at the ratio of the [[Sensible Heat Flux]] versus the [[Latent Heat Flux]]. This is known as the **Bowen Ratio** ($\beta$). 

$$
\beta = H/ \lambda E 
$$

If $\beta <1$ , a greater proportion of the available energy goes into latent heat flux. If $\beta >1$, more energy goes into sensible heat flux.

>[!Important]
>Additionally, sensible and latent heat flux compete. A high H means a low $\lambda E$ and vice versa. This is because the outgoing energy flux is (assumed to be) relatively constant
