The **Two-Dimensional Discharge** ($q$) refers to the [[Discharge]] as calculated using [[Darcy's Law]] when limited to 2 dimensions. In practice, this results in the water flow per unit of width, achieved by taking the groundwater discharge $Q$ and dividing by the soil layer width $B$. This quantity is useful when the vertical cross-section is similar for a longer distance (for example flow under a long dam). It is computed as 

$$
q=kD \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x}
$$

When the two-dimensional discharge is reduced another dimension, namely layer depth $D$, we end up with the [[Flux Density]].
