The **Response Time** (also called **lag time**, $t_r$) is the time difference between a rainfall event and the resulting discharge peak. It is usually measured as the time difference between the center of mass of the rainfall event and the maximum discharge (or the center of mass of the discharge peak). Catchment response times depend on both the shape of the channel network and the runoff processes which take place in the catchment.
