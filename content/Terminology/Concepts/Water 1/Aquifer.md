A layer that consists of permeable material (i.e. with high [[Permeability|Conductivity]], for example gravel or sand) is called an **Aquifer** or permeable layer. Aquifers can transport water easily and are characterised by their [[Conductance]] ($kD$)

Two special types of aquifer are the [[Phreatic Aquifer]] and the [[Confined Aquifer]]
