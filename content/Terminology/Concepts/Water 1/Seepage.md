**Seepage** refers to the upward flow of water in a soil. 

>[!Note]
>Note that in some disciplines (such as ecohydrology) the word seepage always means upward flow, and downward flow is called [[Infiltration]], while in other fields (such as catchment hydrology) seepage can be both upward and downward.
