The downward movement of water from the soil surface through the soil is called **Infiltration**. Infiltration determines the distribution of precipitation between storage on the surface (as ponds) and surface runoff on the one hand, subsurface storage (groundwater and soil moisture) and subsurface runoff (drainage) on the other hand.
