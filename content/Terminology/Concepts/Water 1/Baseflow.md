In humid and temperate regions, rivers usually have a certain amount of water flowing, even when it has not rained for a long time. This 'minimum' discharge is called the **Baseflow** and mainly originates from the groundwater in a catchment. The amount of baseflow mainly depends on the underlying soil. A thick aquifer (a permeable soil layer that stores and transports water) can store much water during wet periods and releases it slowly afterwards,. resulting in a long-lasting baseflow

During wet conditions (seasons), when the groundwater levels are relatively high, the baseflow is higher than in dry periods. The slow decrease in baseflow during dry periods is called the [[Recession]]. In smaller catchments in (semi-)arid climates or with little groundwater storage, the baseflow can drop to zero and the river runs dry. This often happens to first-order streams. Streams which carry water year-round are called [[Perennial Streams]] or rivers and streams which run dry part of the year are [[Ephemeral Streams]]

The baseflow is part of the [[Hydrograph]], together with the [[Quickflow]]
