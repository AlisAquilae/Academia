The vertical transportation capacity of a soil layer is called the **resistance** ($c$ in days). It is simply the layer thickness $D$ divided by the [[Permeability|Conductivity]] $k$: 

$$
c=\frac{D}{k}
$$

This equation shows that a thick layer of poorly permeable material hampers flow.

Whereas the resistance looks at the vertical transportation capacity, its counterpart which looks at the horizontal transportation capacity is called the [[Conductance]]
