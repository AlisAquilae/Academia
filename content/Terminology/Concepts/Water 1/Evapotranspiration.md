Evapotranspiration is a term used to refer to the combined processes by which water moves from the earthâ€™s surface into the atmosphere. It covers both water evaporation and transpiration. 

Seeing as evapotranspiration is an active process, it requires some form of energy. This energy sink is known as the [[Latent Heat Flux]]. 

The total evapotranspiration of an area consists of:
1. Transpiration 
2. Interception evaporation
3. Soil evaporation
4. Open water evaporation.

# Evapotranspiration Equations
In absence of good measurement techniques, people often use equations based on meteorological observations to estimate evapotranspiration. There are many of these equations, with different levels of accuracy and data requirements. The simplest requires only temperature, the equation used by the Dutch meteorological institute (the method of Makkink) uses incoming short-wave radiation and temperature, and more complex equations (e.g. the method of Penman) also use air humidity and wind speed.

These equations give the [[Reference Evapotranspiration]], which is the ET that theoretically could take place for the actual meteorological conditions over well-watered grassland (the conditions at most meteorological stations).

To obtain the [[Potential Evapotranspiration]], which is the ET that could take place for the actual meteorological conditions and local vegetation, assuming that this vegetation has enough water to transpire, the reference evapotranspiration should be multiplied with a crop factor ($f$): 

$$
ET_{\text{pot}}=f \cdot ET_{\text{ref}}
$$

The crop factor depends on the type of vegetation and varies seasonally

The [[Actual Evapotranspiration]] is the ET that occurs in reality, so for certain meteorological conditions for a certain land use and including possible water stress. Actual ET has to be determined from the potential evapotranspiration and the current soil moisture content in the rooting zone. The soil moisture can be determined from field measurements or computer models.
