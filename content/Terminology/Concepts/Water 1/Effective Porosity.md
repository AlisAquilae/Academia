Some of the water in a soil is attached to soil particles and does not move. The **Effective Porosity** ($n_e$ in %) is the fraction of the soil volume that is filled with water that can move, and is used to compute flow velocities and residence times. The effective porosity is always somewhat smaller than the total [[Porosity]].
