The **Specific Storage** ($S_w$ in mm) is the volume of water in the soil (m$^3$) per unit of area (m$^2$). Infiltrating rain water that [[Percolation|Percolates]] to the groundwater increases the specific storage and evaporation decreases the specific storage. The effect of this addition or removal of water on the groundwater level ($h$ in mm) is much larger. For example, 1mm of rainfall often causes groundwater rise in the order of 1 cm. 

The specific storage is used in the calculation of the [[Storativity]]
