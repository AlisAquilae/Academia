The **saturated zone** refers to the area below the [[Groundwater Table]]. In the saturated zone, all pores are completely filled with water. The water in this zone is called [[Groundwater]].

>[!Note]
>Technically speaking, above the groundwater table exists the [[Capillary Fringe]], which is completely saturated and therefore still considered to be part of the saturated zone
