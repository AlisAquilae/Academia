Albedo is the percentage of (short-wave) solar radiation that is reflected instead of absorbed in relation to the surface and atmosphere properties. A high albedo means not much energy is absorbed by the surface, and a lot of energy is reflected, hence contributing to the cooling of the climate.

It is important to note that different Earth surfaces have different levels of Albedo. Ice and snow have high albedo's. Moreover, vegetation usually has a lower albedo than bare soil.
