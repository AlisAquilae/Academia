The **pressure head**, in the context of hydrology, is the local pressure on a water droplet as it would be measured using a pressure meter (converted to a water column length). This pressure is mostly caused by the pressure of the groundwater above it, but it is often increased (when groundwater is pushed to the location of interest from somewhere else) or decreased (when groundwater is led away from the location). 

Groundwater droplets always experience a positive pressure compared to atmospheric pressure. In hydrology, atmospheric pressure is used as a reference for the pressure head (zero pressure). Hence, the pressure equals zero at all places that are accessible to the atmosphere (for example at the groundwater table). Although atmospheric pressure varies in space and time, it may be considered constant for groundwater applications, which concern slow (years to centuries) and regional (10-50 km) processes.

The pressure head is used in the calculation of the [[Hydraulic Head]]
