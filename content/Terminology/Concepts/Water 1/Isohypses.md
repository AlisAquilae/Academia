For [[Phreatic Aquifer|Phreatic Aquifers]], lines connecting points with equal groundwater levels (called [[Isohypses]]) can be drawn on maps. Since the hydraulic head corresponds to the groundwater level in phreatic aquifers, isohypses are a type of equipotential lines and we use the terms interchangeably. Maps with isohypses immediately show the flow direction, which can be used to determine which area drains towards a certain river or in which direction potential pollutants will move.

**Isohypses** are lines connecting points with equal groundwater levels. Given the need for a [[Groundwater Table]] for the groundwater level to be determined, isohypses can only be drawn for [[Phreatic Aquifer|Phreatic Aquifers]]. 

Since the [[Hydraulic Head]] corresponds to the groundwater level in phreatic aquifers, isohypses are a type of [[Equipotential Lines]] and we use the terms interchangeably.
