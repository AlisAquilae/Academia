The latent heat flux is the turbulent transfer of energy from the surface to the air in the form of the [[Evapotranspiration]] of water. It is the same as the [[Sensible Heat Flux]], just for water instead of heat. It is therefore sometimes referred to as the 'wet' energy flux.

Together with the sensible heat flux, it makes up the energy fluxes from the earth, and following the [[Energy Balance Model]] equals the incoming energy. 

The latent and sensible heat fluxes both make up the [[Bowen Ratio]]

>[!Important]
>Additionally, sensible and latent heat flux compete. A high H means a low $\lambda E$ and vice versa. This is because the outgoing energy flux is (assumed to be) relatively constant
