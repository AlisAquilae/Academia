To obtain the **Potential Evapotranspiration**, which is the ET that could take place for the actual meteorological conditions and local vegetation, assuming that this vegetation has enough water to transpire, the [[Reference Evapotranspiration]] should be multiplied with a crop factor ($f$): 

$$
ET_{\text{pot}}=f \cdot ET_{\text{ref}}
$$

The crop factor depends on the type of vegetation and varies seasonally
