The **water balance** provides information about the total amounts of water which move into or out of a system during a certain period. The water balance is a powerful tool to get insight in the way an area interacts with its surroundings, which is important for many applications. 

The water balance is an application of the law of mass conversion (the mass balance): 

$$
Q_{in} - Q_{out} = \Delta S
$$

The difference between the inflow $Q_{in}$ and outflow $Q_{out}$ is the stored volume of water $\Delta S$. If, during a certain period, more water entered the area than left, then at the end of the period there is more water stored in the area than at the start.

In a water balance, we sum all incoming fluxes $Q_{in}$ and subtract the sum of all outgoing fluxes $Q_{out}$. Together, these fluxes (in - out) have to equal the change in storage $\Delta S$. The terms that are part of a water balance differ per area. The most complete form of the water balance is: 

$$
P-ET \pm Q \pm U_s \pm U_t \pm X = \Delta S
$$

Where:
- $P$ is precipitation (rain, snow, dew)
- $ET$ is [[Evapotranspiration]] (interception evaporation, soil evaporation and transpiration)
- $Q$ is inflow minus outflow of the surface waters
- $U_s$ is upward (positive) or downward (negative) [[Seepage]]
- $U_t$ is lateral inflow (positive) or outflow (negative) of groundwater (this concerns horizontal groundwater flow, while seepage is vertical groundwater flow)
- $X$ is additional sources and sinks, such as groundwater extraction, irrigation with water from outside the balance area, effluent from wastewater treatment flowing into the river, or water being discharged via the sewage system outside of the balance area
- $\Delta S$ is the storage change (in groundwater, surface water, soil moisture or snow)

In many natural catchments seepage, lateral groundwater flow and surface water inflow are not present, which simplifies the equation to: 

$$
P-ET-Q = \Delta S
$$


>[!Note]
>The units of the water balance terms can very between applications, as long as they are the same for all terms. Often, the units are in the form of $L \, T^{-1}$ or $L^3 \, T^{-1}$ where L is an arbitrary length unit and T an arbitrary time unit. Water balances for catchments are usually expressed in mm y$^{-1}$ or mm d$^{-1}$, because these units allow comparison with other catchments of different sizes.
