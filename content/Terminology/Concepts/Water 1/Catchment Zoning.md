In general, we can divide the catchment area of a river, from source to outlet, in 3 zones:
1. Zone 1 is the **upper course** or upstream area, which consists of various sub-catchments with a dense dendritic (tree-shaped) network of channels. We call this area the [[Production Zone]], because this is the main region where the surface water and sediments are formed. 
2. Zone 2 is the **middle course**, consists of a distinguished main channel which often meanders through the landscape. This main channel only has a few branches. We call this area the [[Transport Zone]] because sediment is transported downstream.
3. Zone 3 is the **lower course** or downstream area. This is the delta where the river divides into multiple branches again as a result of the flat landscape, and as a result of the large amount of water and sediment present in the river. We call this area the [[Deposition Zone]], because the low flow velocity causes sediment to settle
