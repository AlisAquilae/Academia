**Capillary rise** is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces against the force of gravity. It is driven by the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules and the adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid surface. 

In the context of hydrology, the opposite of capillary rise is [[Percolation]]. This occurs mostly when the [[Groundwater Table]] is shallow, due to being "sucked" upwards by a negative pressure caused by  [[Evapotranspiration]] in the top soil
