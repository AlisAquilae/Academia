The **Actual Evapotranspiration** is the [[Evapotranspiration]] that occurs in reality, so for certain meteorological conditions for a certain land use and including possible water stress. Actual evapotranspiration has to be determined from the [[Potential Evapotranspiration]] and the current soil moisture content in the rooting zone. The soil moisture can be determined from field measurements or computer models.
