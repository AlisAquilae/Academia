The Draining Area of a certain point in the landscape is the surface water uphill (above that point and up to the water divide) because water from that area all flows towards that point. If the draining area is large, a large amount of water has to pass by this point, increasing the wetness (and flood risk). Similarly, if the slope of the land surface at that point is high, the water flows quickly, reducing wetness and flood risk.
