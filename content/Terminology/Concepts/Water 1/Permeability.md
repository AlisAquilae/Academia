The **permeability** ($k$) refers to how well a liquid can flow through a material. In the context of catchment hydrology, it refers to how well the empty spaces between soil particles are connected. The [[Porosity]] is therefore another important value to determine water movement through a soil.

Mineral soils with large grains (gravel and course sand) have a higher conductivity than soil types with small particles (clay). Large particles cannot be packed firmly together, which leads to large pore spaces. Water can then move easily from one pore to the next because the 'channels' between the particles are wider, resulting in a higher flow velocity.

Water flows less easily through unsaturated soil, as water can only flow through the water film attached to the soil particles. The maximum conductivity is therefore reached when the soil is saturated: the [[Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity]].

Conductivity is used in determining the [[Conductance]] and the [[Resistance]] of a soil layer
