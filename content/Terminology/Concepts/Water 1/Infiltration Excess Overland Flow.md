**Infiltration Excess Overland Flow** refers to the situation where the intensity of a precipitation event is higher than the infiltration capacity of the top soil. As a result, [[Surface Runoff]] occurs. 

It is based on [[Horton's Equation]]

>[!Important]
>Summarising the requirements to get Horton overland flow due to an infiltration surplus are:
>- The [[Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity]] of the soil is smaller than the precipitation intensity
>- The duration of the precipitation shower is larger than the [[Ponding Time]].
