The [[Infiltration]] speed varies. The maximum possible infiltration speed at a certain moment is called the **Infiltration Capacity**. When the precipitation intensity is below the infiltration capacity, all rain will infiltrate. When the precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity, some rain will not infiltrate and stay on the land surface

The infiltration capacity depends on land cover, soil type and soil wetness. The state of the upper soil layer (1-2 mm) has a large influence on the infiltration capacity. Pavement, for example, reduces the infiltration capacity drastically. Vegetation cover improves the stability and structure of the soil, which results in a higher and a more stable infiltration capacity.

Besides the state of the top soil, the water transportation capacity of the layer below this top layer is important for the downward transport of water. Therefore, sandy soils have higher infiltration capacities than clayey soils (unless they have cracks that occur when the clay dries and shrinks).

>[!Note]
>Generally, the infiltration capacity decreases during a rainfall event, when the topsoil becomes wetter, leaving less space for new water. However, the transportation capacity of the lower layer increases with soil wetness. When a soil becomes very dry, it can become hydrophobic (water resistant): the infiltration capacity is very small and most rain water will not infiltrate.
