**Unconsolidated sediment** refers to a soil of which the soil particles are loosely arranged or unstratified (not in layers), or whose particles are not cemented together. Unconsolidated sediment can be found either at the ground surface or at a depth below the surface.

Through a variety of processes, unconsolidated sediment can be turned into [[Consolidated Sediment]], forming bedrock.
