A **Hydrograph** is a [[Discharge]] time series. It provides information about the 'behaviour' of the catchment: the timing and height of discharge peaks after precipitation events and the slow decrease of discharge in dry periods. Studying the hydrograph together with the precipitation time series provides information about how the catchment works and makes it possible to predict how the discharge regime will change when land use, climate or water management change. It is also possible to determine how often high or low flows occur and estimate the risk of floods as well as dry periods. Finally, hydrographs help to forecast water levels and discharges after extreme precipitation events

A hydrograph contains 2 components:
- The [[Baseflow]]
- The [[Quickflow]]
