**Recession** refers to the slow decrease in [[Baseflow]] during dry periods.

Recession curves often have a negative exponential shape: 

$$
Q(t)=Q_0 \cdot e^{-c \, t}
$$

where:
- $Q(t)$ is the [[Discharge]] at time $t$ after the start of the recession (in L$^3$ T$^{-1}$)
- $Q_0$ is the discharge at time 0 (at the start of the recession) in L$^3$ T$^{-1}$
- $c$ is the recession coefficient (in T$^{-1}$) 

A small $c$ results in a slowly decreasing discharge. So if $c$ is small, the supply of groundwater to the stream will take place for a longer time during dry periods

We can explain the exponential shape of the recession curve with the mass balance of the groundwater reservoir, of which we can describe the behaviour with a linear reservoir. During the recession, we can assume the groundwater recharge to be zero. Hence, due to the drainage of the groundwater, groundwater tables will slowly decline. As a result of this, the difference in [[Hydraulic Head]] between groundwater and the river, so the driving force behind the groundwater flow, will decline as well.
