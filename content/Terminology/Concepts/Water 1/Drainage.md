At every point in a river bank, groundwater can flow towards the surface water (often not visible). This process is called **Drainage**. In many areas drainpipes (or drains) are installed in agricultural fields and residential areas to increase drainage speed and reduce the probability of inundation. 

>[!Note]
>A large amount of water can be stored in the ground. This slowly empties into the river by drainage and therefore regulates the discharge of the river, especially in dry periods, when the contribution from groundwater to the river discharge is large. If the groundwater table is lower (deeper) than the surface water level, infiltration of surface water takes place. Hence, groundwater has a significant impact on discharge behaviour in rivers and thus on the water cycle of catchments.
