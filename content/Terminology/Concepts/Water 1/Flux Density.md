The **Flux Density** ($v$) refers to the groundwater discharge, as calculated using [[Darcy's Law]], when considered per unit of area. This is achieved by taking Darcy's Law and dividing by the width and depth of the soil area under consideration. 

>[!Note]
>The flux density is not the same as the [[Flow Velocity]] since part of the soil is occupied by soil particles. 

The flux density is computed as 

$$
v=k \, \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta x}
$$


>[!Question]
>The aquifer of the previous questions is 12 m thick. Give the flux density
