The sensible heat flux $H$ is the turbulent transfer of energy from the surface to the air in the form of heat exchanges. It is the same as the [[Latent Heat Flux]], just for heat instead of water. It is therefore sometimes referred to as the 'dry' energy flux

Together with the sensible heat flux, it makes up the energy fluxes from the earth, and following the [[Energy Balance Model]] equals the incoming radiation

The sensible and latent heat fluxes both make up the [[Bowen Ratio]]

>[!Important]
>Additionally, sensible and latent heat flux compete. A high H means a low $\lambda E$ and vice versa. This is because the outgoing energy flux is (assumed to be) relatively constant
