Channels that are located in the [[Headwater]] of a catchment behave differently from channels further downstream:
- They run dry more often
- The chemistry of the stream water is only determined by local conditions (and not influenced by water coming from upstream)

To distinguish these types of channels, **Network Ordering** can be applied. 

The channel network can be divided into:
- **Links** (channel segments) 
- **Junctions** (locations where channels merge). 
- A **source** is a location upstream where a channel starts. 
- Links between a source and the first junction are called **exterior links**
- Links between two junctions are called **interior links**
- The [[Debouchment|Outlet]] is the end-point downstream

A common network ordering method is [[Strahler Order Numbering]].
