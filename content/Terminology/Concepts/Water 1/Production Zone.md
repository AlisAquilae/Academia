The Production Zone, in the context of [[Catchment Zoning]], refers to the upstream area or upper course of a catchment, which consists of various sub-catchments with a dense dendritic (tree-shaped) network of channels. We call this area the production zone, because this is the main region where the surface water and sediments are formed. 

The other zones identified are the [[Transport Zone]] and the [[Deposition Zone]]
