During and shortly after a rainfall event water can reach the channels via short pathways, such as surface runoff and flow through macropores (e.g. drainpipes, cracks in clayey soils or animal burrows), and cause a quick rise in discharge and water level. This component of the [[Hydrograph]] is called the **Quickflow** (also called direct runoff) and causes the peaks on top of the [[Baseflow]]. Of course, part of the rainwater infiltrates and percolates to the groundwater, which results in a slightly higher discharge over a longer period (due to the higher baseflow). Quickflow to the channels is a much faster process than the water flow from groundwater to the channels, which has to follow a longer route with more resistance. Therefore, floods and inundations are often caused by quickflow.

Factors that increase the probability of quickflow and high discharge peaks are:
- **Steep Topography**: Water flows fast in channels and through hillslopes and ponding results in surface runoff. In flat areas, the water that does not infiltrate stays in ponds and infiltrates later. 
- **Low Infiltration Capacity**: Precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity, leading to [[Infiltration Excess Overland Flow]]
- **High Drainage Intensity**: The distance towards the surface water (through or over the soil) is small and hence the travel time is short
- **Hydrophobic Soil**: Water cannot infiltrate, leading to [[Surface Runoff]]
- **High Precipitation Intensity**: Infiltration capacity is exceeded, leading to [[Infiltration Excess Overland Flow]]. When the same amount of precipitation is spread over a longer period, the water can infiltrate and percolate to the groundwater
- **Uneven Precipitation Distribution**: When a large amount of precipitation falls on one location, the soil becomes saturated locally, leading to saturation excess overland flow. When the precipitation is more evenly distributed over the catchment, the soil will probably be able to store all the water. 
- **Wet Initial Conditions**: When groundwater level and soil moisture content are high (due to previous precipitation events or a wet climate), flow through drainpipes and macropores occurs, leading to high discharge peaks. [[Saturation Excess Overland Flow]] can also occur and amplify this effect.
- **Rain on Snow**: When rain falls on a snow cover, the snow melts quickly. If the soil is frozen, water cannot infiltrate, leading to surface runoff
