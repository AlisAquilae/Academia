The transport zone, in the context of [[Catchment Zoning]], refers to the middle course of a catchment. This area consists of a distinguished main channel which often meanders through the landscape. This main channel only has a few branches. We call this area the transport zone because sediment is transported downstream.

The other zones identified are the [[Production Zone]] and the [[Deposition Zone]]
