The **Storativity** ($\mu$) is the ratio between the change in [[Specific Storage]] ($S_w$) and the change in groundwater level ($h$): 

$$
\mu=\frac{\Delta S_w}{\Delta h}
$$


This refers to the fact that the effect of addition or removal of water on the groundwater level ($h$ in mm) is much larger. For example, 1mm of rainfall often causes groundwater rise in the order of 1 cm. Thus, the storativity

>[!Question]
>It rains 5 mm on a soil with a storativity of 8%. How much does the groundwater table rise?
>
>>[!Check]- Answer
>>The rainfall event causes the specific storage to rise with 5 mm, because 5 mm of water is added to the soil. $$\mu = \frac{\Delta S_w}{\Delta h} \to \Delta h = \frac{\Delta S_w}{\mu} = \frac{5}{0.08} = 62.5 \; \text{mm} = 6.25 \; \text{cm} $$The groundwater level change should always be larger than the change in specific storage

>[!Note]
>The storativity is not constant, but depends on the groundwater level and the past weather (whether the soil is drying or moistening)

| Soil Type | Storativity ($\mu$) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Heavy clays | 0.02 |
| Light clays | 0.03 - 0.04 |
| Permeable sabulous clays | 0.05 - 0.07 |
| Permeable sands | 0.10 - 0.12 |
| Peat soils | 0.1 - 0.5 |
| Living peat | up to 0.8 |
| Surface water | 1 |
