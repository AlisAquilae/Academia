Groundwater droplets experience forces that may push them in a certain direction. The forces originate from differences in energy between different locations. In hydrology and hydraulics, these energies are usually measured as the length of a water column that would lead to the same [[PotentiÃ«le Energie|Potential Energy]]. The total energy of a droplet is called the **Potential** and the corresponding water column height is called the **Hydraulic Head** ($H$ in m). The hydraulic head consists of 2 components: the [[Elevation Head]] ($z$ in m) and the [[Pressure Head]] ($h$ in m):

H=z+h
