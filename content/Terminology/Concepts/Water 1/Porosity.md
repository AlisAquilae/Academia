**Porosity** ($n$, in %) is a measure of the empty space, i.e. void space, within a material. In soils or rocks, porosity refers to the empty space between soil particles. Specifically, it is a measure of the fraction of the soil volume that is not taken up by soil particles. Thus, porosity is usually expressed as the ratio of the volume of voids, $V_v$, to the total unit volume, $V_t$. of a soil or rock, such that 

$$
n = \frac{V_v}{V_t}
$$


>[!Note]
>In saturated soils, this gives the water fraction in the soil. 

>[!Example]
>Sand has rather large particles which don't fit together very closely. This soil type has a high porosity

Together with [[Permeability]], it determines how well water flows through a soil.

| Soil material | Subtype | Conductivity $k$ (m/d) | Porosity $n$ (%) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Gravel |  | > 250 | 25 - 40 |
| Sand | Coarse | 5 - 100 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Fine | 1 - 5 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Very fine | 0.2 - 0.5 | 30 - 50 |
| Clay | With large fractures | 10 - 100 | 45 - 70 |
|  | Some macropores or fractures | 0.5 - 2 | 35 - 60 |
|  | No macropores or fractures | < 0.005 | 35 - 60 |
| Peat | Above groundwater table | 0.1 - 5 | 60 - 85 |
|  | Below groundwater table | 0.0001 - 0.5 | 50 - 80 |

In general, unconsolidated sediments such as gravels, sands, silts and clays, which are composed of angular and rounded particles, have larger porosities than indurated, consolidated sediments such as sandstone and limestone. Crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks have especially low porosities because the pores are merely within the inter-crystal surfaces. Conversely, formations rich in platy clay minerals with very fine grain size can achieve high porosity values.

A special variant of the porosity is the [[Effective Porosity]]

Porosity is closely associated with the [[Void Ratio]]. The relation between the two can be expressed as 

$$
n = \frac{e}{(1+e)}
$$

or

$$
e = \frac{n}{(1-n)}
$$
