**Porosity** ($n$, in %) is a measure of the empty space within a material. In soils or rocks, porosity refers to the empty space between soil particles. Specifically, it is a measure of the fraction of the soil volume that is not taken up by soil particles

>[!Note]
>In saturated soils, this gives the water fraction in the soil. 

>[!Example]
>Sand has rather large particles which don't fit together very closely. This soil type has a high porosity

Together with [[Permeability]], it determines how well water flows through a soil.

| Soil material | Subtype | Conductivity $k$ (m/d) | Porosity $n$ (%) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Gravel |  | > 250 | 25 - 40 |
| Sand | Coarse | 5 - 100 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Fine | 1 - 5 | 30 - 50 |
|  | Very fine | 0.2 - 0.5 | 30 - 50 |
| Clay | With large fractures | 10 - 100 | 45 - 70 |
|  | Some macropores or fractures | 0.5 - 2 | 35 - 60 |
|  | No macropores or fractures | < 0.005 | 35 - 60 |
| Peat | Above groundwater table | 0.1 - 5 | 60 - 85 |
|  | Below groundwater table | 0.0001 - 0.5 | 50 - 80 |

The porosity is higher for clay than gravel, since small particles take up less space. 

A special variant of the porosity is the [[Effective Porosity]]
