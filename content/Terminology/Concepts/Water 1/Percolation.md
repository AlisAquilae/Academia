Water that has [[Infiltration|Infiltrated]] into the soil will move slowly downward through the unsaturated zone towards the saturated zone. This flow is called **Percolation** and is caused by gravity. Percolation through the soil matrix is a slow process. However, there are often macropores such as cracks in clay soils or rocks in animal burrows which speed this process up.

The opposite of percolation is [[Capillary Rise]]
