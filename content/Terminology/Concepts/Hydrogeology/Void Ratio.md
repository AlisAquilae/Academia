The **void ratio** $e$, of a solid material is the ratio of the volume of voids, $V_v$, to the volume of the solid material, $V_s$, such that

$$
e = \frac{V_v}{V_s}
$$
The void ratio is closely related to [[Porosity]], $n$. The relation between the two can be expressed as 

$$
n = \frac{e}{(1+e)}
$$

or

$$
e = \frac{n}{(1-n)}
$$
