The **intrinsic permeability**, $k_i$ is representative of the properties of a porous material alone and is related to the size of the openings through which the fluid moves. The intrinsic permeability is more generally expressed as 

$$
k_i = Cd^2
$$

where
- $d$ is equal to the mean pore diameter, and
- $C$ represents a dimensionless ‘shape factor’ assessing the contribution made by the shape of the pore openings, as influenced by the relationship between the pore and grain sizes and their effect on the tortuosity of fluid flow.

The intrinsic permeability is used in the calculation of the [[Permeability|Hydraulic Conductivity]]
