Not all the water contained in the pore space of a soil or rock can be viewed as being available to groundwater flow, particularly in fine grained or fractured aquifers. In an aquifer with a water table, the volume of water released from groundwater storage per unit surface area of aquifer per unit decline in the water table is known as the **Specific Yield**, $S_y$. The fraction of water that is retained in the soil or rock against the force of gravity is termed the [[Specific Retention]], $S_r$. 

The sum of the specific yield $S_y$ and the specific retention $S_r$, that is, $S_y + S_r$,, is equal to the total [[Porosity]], $n$.
