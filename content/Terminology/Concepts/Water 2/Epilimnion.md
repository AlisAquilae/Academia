In deep lakes different layers in the water column can be formed especially during the summer period. This is called **Stratification**, and is the result of different temperatures at different depths in the lake. Therefore it is also referred to as **Thermal Stratification**. 

The top layer is called the **Epilimnion** and is in contact with the atmosphere, so the temperature is high and the layer is mixed due to wind. 

The other layers are the [[Metalimnion]] and the [[Hypolimnion]]

In the epilimnion most of the primary production takes place, mainly algae growth. Here the light conditions are good, and temperature is high. Due to primary production and reaeration from the atmosphere dissolved oxygen concentration is generally good.
