In deep lakes different layers in the water column can be formed especially during the summer period. This is called **Stratification**, and is the result of different temperatures at different depths in the lake. Therefore it is also referred to as **Thermal Stratification**. 

At the bottom there is the **Hypolimnion** which is much colder due to lack of incoming light and lack of mixing with he upper layer. 

The other layers are the [[Epilimnion]] and the [[Metalimnion]]

the hypolimnion is a dark layer where the dissolved oxygen concentration is low and can even be depleted (anoxic). Here organic matter, e.g. sinking of dead algae material from the epilimnion, is decomposed consuming oxygen from the water. Because of absence of primary production and reaeration from the atmosphere anoxic conditions can easily exist.
