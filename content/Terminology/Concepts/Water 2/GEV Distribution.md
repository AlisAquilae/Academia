The **GEV Distribution** or **Generalised Extreme Value Distribution** is a way to estimate the probability distribution, for example in the case of precipitation sums.

It is considered more suited for this purpose than the often used [[Gumbel Distribution]], because it is better able to deal with the upper tails of the distribution by incorporating the [[Fr√©chet Distribution]] and the [[Weibull Distribution]] alongside the gumbell distribution.
