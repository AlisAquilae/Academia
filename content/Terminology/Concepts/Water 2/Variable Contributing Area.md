Since groundwater tables are shallow close to a channel, the soil will saturate more quickly closer to a channel than towards the hilltop. The longer the duration of the precipitation event, or when multiple precipitation events occur within a relatively short time span, an increasing part of the catchment will get saturated (often starting around the brook and then expanding). The part of the catchment which will become saturated and thus which contributes to the surface runoff, is called the **Variable Contributing Area**
