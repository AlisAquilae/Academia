**Flow Duration Curves** describe the relationship between certain discharge amounts and the **exceedance probability** of these discharge amounts. Obviously, a small discharge has a higher probability of exceedance than a large discharge amount. 

For an overview of how to create flow duration curves, see [[Water 2 Summary Catchment Hydrology#2.3 Flow Duration Curve]].
