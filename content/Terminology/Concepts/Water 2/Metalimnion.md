In deep lakes different layers in the water column can be formed especially during the summer period. This is called **Stratification**, and is the result of different temperatures at different depths in the lake. Therefore it is also referred to as **Thermal Stratification**. 

In between the [[Epilimnion]] and the [[Hypolimnion]] there is a, generally small, layer where the temperature decreases quickly: the **Metalimnion** or **thermocline**
