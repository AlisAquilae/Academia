**DDF Curves** give for different return periods or exceedance probabilities, the precipitation sum as a function of the event duration. Especially for short durations, the precipitation intensity is often used instead of the precipitation sum (Rainfall [[Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves]]; [[Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves|IDF Curves]]). The method to determine both types is comparable.

For an explanation on how to derive DDF curves, see [[Water 2 Summary Catchment Hydrology#2.5 Rainfall Depth-Duration-Frequency Curves]]
