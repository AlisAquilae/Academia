Why does the cross-section of the river reach certain dimensions? Low discharges often occur, but these amounts only have a limited eroding power. The extreme discharges, however, have a much higher eroding power, but they rarely occur. Hence, the dimensions of a river are determined by the discharge which occurs frequent enough, but which also has sufficient eroding power. This discharge amount is called the **Bankfull Discharge**

The bankfull discharge has a return period of approximately 1.5 years: so, on average two times per three year, the bankfull discharge is reached or exceeded. This amount is sufficient to determine the shape and dimensions of the river.
