Power functions are functions with the form of

$$
f(\text{x})=c\text{x}^p
$$

in which $c$ and $p$ are the parameters. These functions can model very different types of behaviour. If $c$ and $p$ are positive, $f(\text{x})$ is increasing and $f(0)=0$. If $c$ is positive and $p$ is negative, $f(\text{x})$ is decreasing for $\text{x} \gt 0$ and $f(\text{x})$ is decreasing for $\text{x} \lt 0$. 

>[!Note]
>**Roots** are powers too. For example $\sqrt{\text{x}}=\text{x}^{1/2}$ and $\sqrt[n]{\text{x}^m} = \text{x}^{m/n}$

The formulas below help to deal with power functions
- For any integer numbers $m$ and $n$, $a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = \bigl( \sqrt[n]{a} \bigr) ^m$
- For any real number $p$, $a^{-p} = \frac{1}{a^p}$
- For any real number $p$, $(ab)^p = a^p b^p$
- For any real numbers $p$ and $q$, $(a^p)^q = a^{pq}$ 
- For any real numbers $p$ and $q$, $a^p \cdot a^q = a^{p+q}$
