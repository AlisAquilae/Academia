A [[Sequences|Sequence]] that has many applications is the **Geometric Sequence**. It has the form 

$$
t_1=a, t_2=ar, t_3=ar^2, t_3=ar^3, \dots
$$

The nth term is given by $t_n=ar^{n-1}$. Each new term of a geometric sequence arises by multiplying its predecessor by a (constant) factor $r$, so 

$$
t_n=rt_{n-1}
$$

The factor $r$ is called the **common ratio** of the geometric sequence

Worded differently, a sequence is a geometric sequence if the quotient of two consecutive terms is constant:

$$
t_n / t_{n-1}=r
$$

>[!Example]
>If the terms $1, \frac12, \frac14, \frac18, \frac{1}{16}, \dots$ form the beginning of a geometric sequence, then $a=1$ and $r=\frac12$. The nth term is then given by $t_n=\left(\frac12 \right)^{n-1}$

A special type of geometric sequence is the [[Geometric Series]]
