An **Exponential Function** is a function of the form $f(x)=c\,a^x$, where $c$ and $a$ are constants, with $a \gt 0$. The parameter $a$ is called the **base** of the exponential function

>[!Warning]
>Do not confuse the exponential functions $f(x)=c\,a^x$ with the [[Power Functions]] $f(x)=c \, x^p$. Notice the position of the variable $x$

One special exponential function is the function whose tangent line crosses the y-axis at exactly $y=1$. This special case is called $e$, the value of which is $e=2.71828 \dots$ 

The exponential function $f(x)=e^x$ is used so frequently that it is often called THE exponential function. It is also denoted as exp(x)

Below are some rules for powers and exponents:
- For any integer numbers $m$ and $n$, $a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}=\bigl(\sqrt[n]{a}\bigr)^m$ 
- For any real number $p$, $a^{-p} = \frac{1}{a^p}$ and $(ab)^p = a^pb^p$
- For any real numbers $p$ and $q$, $(a^p)^q=a^{pq}$
- For any real numbers $p$ and $q$, $a^p \cdot a^q=a^{p+q}$
