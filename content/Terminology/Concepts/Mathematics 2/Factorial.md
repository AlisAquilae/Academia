The **Factorial** $n!$ (read "n factorial") of a positive integer $n$ is the number 

$$
n!=1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot ... \cdot n \text{ for } n \neq 0 \text{ and } 0!=1
$$

>[!Example]
>$3!=1\cdot 2\cdot 3=6$
>$6!=1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot6=720$

>[!Important]
>The number of possible orderings of $n$ objects is $n!$
