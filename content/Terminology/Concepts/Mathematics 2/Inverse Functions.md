Often, a function is used to describe a causal relationship: a cause x leads to an effect $y$. In other cases, we must proceed the other way around. 

In mathematical terms, the **Inverse Function** of a function $y= f(\text{x})$  with input x and output $y$ is the function $g(y)$ that returns the input x for a given output $y$. The inverse function of $f(\text{x})$ thus gives the solution x of the equation $y=f(\text{x})$ 

>[!Example]
>The inverse function of $f(\text{x})=x^3$ is $g(y) = \sqrt[3]{y}$. That is, $g(y)=y^{1/3}$ 

>[!Note]
>Sometimes the inverse function of $f(\text{x})$ is denoted by $f^{-1} (\text{x})$
