Some functions are periodic because they repeat themselves. The most important periodic functions are the **Trigonometric Functions** $\sin(\Theta)$, $\cos(\Theta)$ and $\tan(\Theta)$.

Take a point $P=(x, y)$ on a circle about the origin with radius $r$. If $\Theta$ is the angle of $OP$ with respect to the positive x-axis, then:
- $\sin(\Theta)=\frac{y}{r}$
- $\cos(\Theta)=\frac{x}{r}$
- $\tan(\Theta)=\frac{y}{x}$

Often we measure the angle $\Theta$ in radians, abbreviated rad. A full revolution is $2\pi$ rad.

| $\Theta$ in rad | $\Theta$ in $\deg$ | $\sin(\Theta)$    | $\cos(\Theta)$    | $\tan(\Theta)$    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 0               | 0                  | 0                 | 1                 | 0                 |
| $\frac16\pi$    | 30                 | $\frac12$         | $\frac12\sqrt{3}$ | $\frac13\sqrt{3}$ |
| $\frac14\pi$    | 45                 | $\frac12\sqrt{2}$ | $\frac12\sqrt{2}$ | 1                 |
| $\frac13\pi$    | 60                 | $\frac12\sqrt{3}$ | $\frac12$         | $\sqrt{3}$        |
| $\sqrt12\pi$    | 90                 | 1                 | 0                 | $\pm \infty$      |

There are many formulas and relations between trigonometric functions which are known, for example $\sin(\Theta)^2 + \cos(\Theta)^2=1$
