A characteristic of all polynomials $f(\text{x})$ is that $f(\text{x}) \to \pm \, \infty$ as $\text{x} \to \pm \, \infty$ . This trait puts an important restriction on the phenomena that we can model with [[Polynomials]]. This restriction does not apply to **Rational Functions**, which are quotients of two polynomials: 

$$
f(\text{x}) = \frac{p(\text{x})}{q(\text{x})}
$$
