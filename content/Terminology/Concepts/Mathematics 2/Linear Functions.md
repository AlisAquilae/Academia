The simplest type of functions are the **Linear Functions**: 

$$
y=f(\text{x})=a \text{x}+b
$$

The graph of a linear function is a straight line.

>[!Note]
>If $a=0$ and $b=0$, this line coincides with the x-axis

The numbers $a$ and $b$ are **parameters**: they determine the behaviour of the function. 
- The point of intersection with the y-axis (at $\text{x}=0$) is located at $y=b$, so $b$ is the **vertical intercept**
- $a$ is called the **slope** of the line. The larger $a$ the steeper the line; when we add 1 unit to x, then $y$ increases by $a$ units. If $a$ is negative, then the line is decreasing

>[!Info]
>If the graph of $y$ as a function of $\text{x}$ is a straight line, the graph of $\text{x}$ as a function of $y$ is a straight line too.
