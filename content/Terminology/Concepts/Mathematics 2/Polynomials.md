**Polynomials** are a type of mathematical functions. This group contains the [[Linear Functions]] (also called linear polynomials): 

$$
f(\text{x})=a \text{x} +b
$$

Next, there are **quadratic polynomials**: 

$$
f(\text{x}) = a \text{x}^2 + b \text{x} + c
$$

The general formula of a polynomial is: 

$$
f(\text{x}) = a_0 \text{x}^n = a_1 \text{x}^{n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} \text{x} + a_n
$$

If $a_0 \neq 0$, then $n$ is the **degree** of the polynomial. The parameters $a_0$, $\dots$, $a_n$ are called the **coefficients**.

>[!Important]
>Thus, a polynomial with a degree of 2 is a quadratic polynomial. The graph is called a **parabola**

For the quadratic polynomial $f(\text{x}) = a \text{x}^2 + b \text{x} + c$ (with $a \neq 0$) we have
- if $a \gt 0$, then the graph is a parabola opening upwards, with minimum at $\text{x}=-b/(2a)$ and $f(\text{x}) \rightarrow \infty$ 
- If $a \lt 0$, then the graph is a parabola opening downwards, with maximum at $\text{x}=-b/(2a)$ and $f(\text{x}) \rightarrow -\infty$
- If the **discriminant** $D=b^2 - 4ac$ is positive, then $f(\text{x})$ has zeros at :
  $$
  \text{x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b \, \pm \, \sqrt{D}}{2a} = \frac{-b \, \pm \, \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  $$
