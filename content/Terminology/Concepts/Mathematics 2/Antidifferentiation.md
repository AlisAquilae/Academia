The reverse process of [[Differentiation]] is **Antidifferentiation**. In antidifferentiating a function $g(x)$, we look for a function $f(x)$ such that $f'(x)=g(x)$. The function $f(x)$ is called an **antidervative** of $g(x)$. 

The requested function in antidifferentiation is not uniquely defined. We can always add a constant to a given solution, to produce a different function with the same derivative; this constant disappears in differentiation. Therefore, the antiderivative of a function is defined up to a constant

>[!Example]
>All the antiderivatives of $f(x)=2x+1$ can be written as $F(x)=x^2+x+C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant

The antiderivative is denoted using $F(x)$ (with a capital $F$)
