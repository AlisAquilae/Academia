In 1863, Dupuit made the assumption that for most circumstances the error in the estimation of groundwater flow will be relatively small when the vertical stream component is neglected. Forchheimer continued with his ideas in 1914, which resulted in the so-called **Dupuit Assumptions**, which state that the flow in aquifers can be simplified to horizontal flow and flow through aquitards can be simplified to vertical flow. These assumptions make analyses of three-dimensional groundwater systems much easier.
