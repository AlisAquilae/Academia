In 1863, Dupuit made the assumption that for most circumstances the error in the estimation of groundwater flow will be relatively small when the vertical stream component is neglected. Forchheimer continued with his ideas in 1914, which resulted in the so-called **Dupuit Assumptions**, which state that the flow in aquifers can be simplified to horizontal flow and flow through aquitards can be simplified to vertical flow. These assumptions make analyses of three-dimensional groundwater systems much easier.

This figure at A displays a fictional groundwater flow pattern. Suppose that the soil of every layer is isotropic, so flow lines are perpendicular to the equipotential lines. If we apply the Dupuit assumptions, the flow pattern will change to B

The aquifers only have horizontal water flow and [[Hydraulic Head]] gradients (so vertical [[Equipotential Lines]]); the aquitards only have vertical water flow and hydraulic head gradients (horizontal equipotential lines - not shown)

For the phreatic aquifer, the consequence of the Dupuit assumptions is that each point in a vertical cross-section through the aquifer has the same hydraulic head, which equals the groundwater level there. From groundwater level measurements at several locations, an isohypse map can be constructed and the direction of the horizontal flow in this aquifer (perpendicular to the isohypses) can be found. In addition, the slope of the groundwater table can be used to calculate the flow magnitude.
