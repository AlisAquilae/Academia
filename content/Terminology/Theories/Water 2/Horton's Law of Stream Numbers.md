In the course Water 1 we introduced the order numbers according to Strahler ([[Strahler Order Numbering]]). When a river system is ordered according to Strahler's ordering, we can ask ourselves whether dendritic networks have certain universal characteristics. For example, we can calculate the number of links/streams in every order: $N_i$ is the number of links/streams of order $i$; $N_{i+1}$ the number of links of order $i+1$, etc. 

If we apply this analysis to a natural catchment, we will discover a notable structure in the data: 

$$
R_B=\frac{N_i}{N_{i+1}}
$$

With $R_B$ a constant value. 

We call $R_B$ the **Bifurcation Number** (*bifurcation* means splitting). If we repeat this analysis for many catchments in the same geomorphological unit (e.g. the Belgian Ardennes), we will get almost the same bifurcation number for every channel. Even between those geomorphological units, the bifurcation number is relatively constant, with an average value of 3.5.

>Globally, the bifurcation number roughly varies between 3 and 5, which is a very small spread for what seems to be a randomly established drainage pattern. 

>[!Note]
>More elongated catchments have larger bifurcation numbers

Also, other transportation networks have similar bifurcation numbers: trees have an average of 3.2, lightning splits with an average ratio of 3.5 and our blood vessels have an $R_B$ of 3.4. Hence, nature gives us a clear ordering in seemingly chaotic transporting systems

The equation above is called **Horton's Law of Stream Numbers**, also called the **Bifurcation Law of Drainage Patterns**. 

An extension of this analysis is [[Horton's Law of Stream Length]]
