Based on [[Strahler Order Numbering]] and [[Horton's Law of Stream Numbers]], we can calculate the average length of the channel of order $i$ with the arithmetic mean: 

$$
\bar{L}_i=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N L_{ij}
$$


The ratio of the average lengths for increasing orders in a catchment also gives constant values: 

$$
R_L=\frac{\bar{L}_i}{\bar{L}_{i-1}} 
$$

with $R_L$ the so-called **length ratio number**. The value for $R_L$ is between 1.5 and 3.5 for natural watercourses. The average length ratio number is 2 for catchments

We call this **Horton's Law of Stream Length**. The average length of a channel doubles (approximately) per increasing order. With an increasing Strahler order, the number of channels in this order will decrease until we reach a point where we can no longer accurately determine the average length of the channel in that order. Therefore, this ratio is often no longer constant for higher Strahler orders.
