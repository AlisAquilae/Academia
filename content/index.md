# 👋🏻 Introduction
This is an online record of my academic journey at Wageningen University & Research. It contains all my notes of the courses which I've followed, including (but not limited to) lecture notes, literature notes, summaries and practice questions. These were processed using Obsidian and published here using Quartz. 

This site contains clickable links, which redirect to other pages on this site (for example [[Water 1]]). This way you can quickly check what a concept is about without having to dig through a file system. 

If you read this, I hope it is useful to you and helps you in your studying endeavours

>Before you continue, I need to make a few disclaimers:
>- The contents of this website are based on papers, books and readers written and published by third parties. I do not own any of these works. I do not make money from publishing this site, though if you appreciate my work you are always free to buy me a coffee
>- The summaries are my own work, and therefore are not to be distributed without my explicit consent. 
>- Since the summaries are my own work, I tend to make slight changes to the original works where I feel like they are beneficial. I might change the way a chapter is structured, leave out parts which I deem redundant, and in doing these things change the numbering of paragraphs. Therefore, do take note that the structure and content of my notes and summaries might be different from the original work (though I will never add content which is not already present)
>- No rights can be derived from what is published here. Content might contain errors which either stem from the original work or were introduced through the process of my summarising. It is therefore important to always check the original work in case of uncertainty

# 🏫 Study Programme
I have followed a rather unusual track. Though I an enrolled in the Master Climate Studies, in which I follow a policy-oriented track, I have recently started shifting more towards the physical domain, specifically on the topic of water. The courses included here contain all the water-courses I have followed, which might deviate from the regular Soil-Water-Atmosphere, International Land and Water Management or similar studies. For example, I have not followed any atmospheric courses, nor do I intend to. As such, notes on these courses are absent. 

On the other hand, I have followed a plethora of other courses in my Bachelor of Public Administration at the Erasmus University. Initially, I do not intend to include the notes of these courses here, partially because they are not fully complete, and partially because they are less relevant for the present. 

That being said, these are the courses which I have followed or intend to follow in the future:
- [[Water 1]]
- [[Water 2]]
- [[Hydrogeology]]
- [[Water and Air Flow Numerical Techniques]]
- [[Geophysical Fluid Mechanics]]
- [[Water Quantity and Quality]]
- [[Catchment and Climate Hydrology]]
- [[Coastal Oceanography and Delta Geology]]
- [[Advanced Hydrogeology]]
- [[Advanced Hydrological Systems Analysis]]
- [[Mathematics 2]]
- [[Mathematics 3]]
- [[Multivariate Mathematics Applied]]
- [[River Flow and Morphology]]

# 🧩 Structure
The content of this website is structured as follows:

- **Courses** are what determine how content is grouped. That being said, concepts and theories which return throughout multiple courses will be referenced multiple times
- **Literature Notes** are notes from course-related readers, books and papers. These are always complete, though often too elaborate to memorise. Consider these as reference for when studying. Moreover, these often do not contain images from the book - I add these later when I make the summaries
- **Lecture Notes** contain information which is not provided in the course literature. In other words, if no note of a lecture exists, or the note is very short, this means that that lecture did not provide much new information to the already memo'd literature 
- **Terminology** refers to jargon, the links of which contain succinct descriptions. Terminology pages will not always be linked; at some point the assumption is made that a term has been mastered. The exception to this is when a term is being expanded on. For example,[[Evapotranspiration]] is linked as a page in the first few chapter of [[Water 1]]; afterwards, unless expanded upon, the term is not linked to anymore. Terminology has been subdivided into
  - **Concepts** for definitions and explanations of principles; 
  - **Theories** for all theories and natural or scientific laws; and 
  - **Events** for pages on specific characteristic events (think of days when Treaties were signed, for example. Less relevant in the context of water, but useful in niche cases)
- **Summaries** are based on the literature as well as the lectures. Though my style of summarising is still very elaborate (since that is what works best for me), I have tried to filter all unnecessary information out. The summaries are the basis of which I learn from my courses
- **Practice Questions** are questions related to a specific (part of a) course, a concept or theory (though these are both generally included in the summary or respective note and not written down separately). Most of these questions are from the readers and books or practice exams, though I might come up with my own questions here and there. All practice questions come with answers and explanations

All content is grouped according to the course it relates to. In case content belongs to multiple courses (for example a concept being discussed multiple times), it is allocated to that course which discussed it first.
